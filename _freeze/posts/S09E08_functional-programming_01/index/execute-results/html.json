This could be situation where you want to run a series of statistical tests, each with a different response variable. Or, you want to make a series of plots, adjusting which variables are on the x-axis. This is generally not a good idea, as it is error prone and inefficient. \n\nWe are going to spend the next few sections of Code Club talking about things you can do to avoid copy and pasting your code. Today, we are going to talk about:\n\n* `for` loops\n\nWe will start, like we typically do, by loading the packages we will use today.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for wrangling and everything\nlibrary(palmerpenguins) # for penguins data\nlibrary(glue) # for easy pasting of names\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# `for` loops\n## `for` loops, the basics\nFor loops iterate over some kind of sequence, performing an action, one element at a time. The basic syntax is like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (item in list_of_items) { # items to iterate over\n  # code that does something\n  do_something(item) # this is a made up function\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's go through a simple example:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (some_value in 1:5) {\n  print(some_value * 2)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n[1] 6\n[1] 8\n[1] 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat is happening under the hood, is that your `for` loop is assigning each item in your vector (here, the integer values 1 through 5) to the object `some_value`, multiplying it by 2, and then printing it. If we want to be very explicit, this is exactly what is happening:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# iteration 1\nsome_value <- 1\nprint(some_value * 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# iteration 2\nsome_value <- 2\nprint(some_value * 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# iteration 3\nsome_value <- 3\nprint(some_value * 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# iteration 4\nsome_value <- 4\nprint(some_value * 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# iteration 5\nsome_value <- 5\nprint(some_value * 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we do this again in the loop: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (some_value in 1:5) {\n  print(some_value * 2)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n[1] 6\n[1] 8\n[1] 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd check what `some_value` is at the end:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsome_value\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that the value 5 (last of `some_value`) is currently assigned. This is not totally intuitive - you might think that `some_value` would hold all of the values that we set to that object in our loop but *this is not true*. This is good to remember since this is now an object lingering in our environment.\n\nI have shown this use-case of a `for` loop because I think it helps you to see how it works - not because you would actually use it to do this task. Because R is a vectorized language, you don't actually need a `for` loop to multiply every value by a number, we can do this task more simply below. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# multiply each element of the vector 1:5 by 2\n1:5 * 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  2  4  6  8 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's do another example. I could create a `for` loop that simply prints something out for me. Here's an example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a vector of the names of my special flowers\nmy_special_flowers <- c(\"dahlias\", \"roses\", \"ranunculus\")\n\n# use a for loop to print this message for each flower\nfor (flower in my_special_flowers) {\n  print(glue(\"I really like {flower}\"))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nI really like dahlias\nI really like roses\nI really like ranunculus\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can also make this conditional, meaning your `for` loop does one thing under certain conditions, and something else in another condition. We can accomplish this by nesting an `if else` statement within our `for` loop. \n\nWe are also making use of the function [`glue()`](https://glue.tidyverse.org/) (which we've gone over before) which allows easy pasting, like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_location <- \"Code Club\"\nglue(\"Welcome to {my_location}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nWelcome to Code Club\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# a vector of solanaceous vegetables\nmy_vegetables <- c(\"Tomato\", \"Potato\", \"Pepper\", \"Eggplant\")\n\nfor (vegetable in my_vegetables) {\n# if the vegetable is tomato, print this message  \n  if (vegetable == \"Tomato\") {\n    print(glue(\"{vegetable} is my favorite Solanaceae vegetable\"))\n  }\n# if the vegetable is anything else, print this message  \n  else {\n    print(glue(\"{vegetable} is a perfectly fine Solanaceae vegetable\"))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTomato is my favorite Solanaceae vegetable\nPotato is a perfectly fine Solanaceae vegetable\nPepper is a perfectly fine Solanaceae vegetable\nEggplant is a perfectly fine Solanaceae vegetable\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### `for` loops basics practice\n\nWrite a `for` loop that takes the vector of numbers -5, -3, 2, 4, 7 and prints their absolute value.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Need a hint?</summary>\n<br>\nThe function for absolute value is `abs()`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Need another hint?</summary>\n<br>\nFirst create a vector of your numbers, then iterate over it.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for the solution</summary>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create your vector of numbers to iterate over\nmy_vector <- c(-5, -3, 2, 4, 7)\n\n# use a for loop to do the iterating\nfor (number in my_vector) {\n  print(abs(number))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5\n[1] 3\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n[1] 7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\nWrite a `for` loop that, when given a number, will tell you whether an positive integer is odd or even.

Making a bunch of plots at once is something that is really easier and less error prone with a `for` loop.\n\nFirst let's revisit our `penguins` data to create a base plot, and then iterate it over a variable to make multiples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(penguins)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 344\nColumns: 8\n$ species           <fct> Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adel…\n$ island            <fct> Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ bill_length_mm    <dbl> 39.1, 39.5, 40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1, …\n$ bill_depth_mm     <dbl> 18.7, 17.4, 18.0, NA, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1, …\n$ flipper_length_mm <int> 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 186…\n$ body_mass_g       <int> 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475, …\n$ sex               <fct> male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, male…\n$ year              <int> 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat if we want to create a plot comparing the `bill_length_mm` vs. `bill_depth_mm` for each species?
