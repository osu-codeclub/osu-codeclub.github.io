[Register here](https://library.osu.edu/events/r-for-scientific-reproducibility-virtual-event-1)!\n\nParticipants will learn:\n\n* The basics of using R in RStudio\n* Best practices for code and project management\n* How to explore, manipulate, and visualize data in R\n\nThis workshop will be run by your Code Club organizers and is presented in partnership with Ohio State's [Imageomics Institute](https://imageomics.osu.edu/) and the [Research Commons](https://library.osu.edu/researchcommons). It will be held on Zoom and will **not be recorded**. It is open to graduate students, faculty, and staff researchers from all disciplines and *no prior experience is required*.\n\nInstallation instructions will be sent to registrants approximately one week before the workshop.
