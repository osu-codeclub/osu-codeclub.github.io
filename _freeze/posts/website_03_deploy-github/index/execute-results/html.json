So far, we have gone through:\n\n1.  How to [initiate your site](https://osu-codeclub.github.io/posts/website_01_initiation/)\n2.  How to [add content](https://osu-codeclub.github.io/posts/website_02/#adding-a-new-page-to-your-site)\n3.  How to [customize its look](https://osu-codeclub.github.io/posts/website_02/#modifying-the-yaml-header-of-our-new-page)\n\nToday, we are going to take our website live, with the help of GitHub, Github Desktop, and Github Pages. You can find all the [source code](https://github.com/osu-codeclub/practice-website) for this [practice website](https://osu-codeclub.github.io/practice-website/) on GitHub.\n\nThe book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a super good resource by Jenny Bryan that talks about all this in extreme detail. Some of my materials below are inspired by some of this material.\n\n## What is Git?\n\n[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that allows materials (mostly code) to exist on the internet (either publicly or privately) in an organized way where changes are tracked. You can think of it as combining the tracked changes capabilities of Word, with the file sharing from OneDrive.\n\nWe are going to use Git (combined with GitHub, more on that in a second) to deploy our website, but it can also be used to share and make code available to collaborators or the wider data science community. You could even use Git for just yourself because it would allow you to always revert back to a previous version of any of your files in case you make a big mistake.\n\nHere is a nice illustration by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/allison-horst) that shows the basics of git (at least the basics of what we will be using).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure from [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)](img/github-cartoon.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A basic git workflow represented as two islands, one with local repo and working directory, and another with remote repo.

GitHub can be free (especially for academic projects), and is where we house all our [Code Club content](https://github.com/osu-codeclub/osu-codeclub.github.io). I additionally use GitHub in my lab for [creating code repositories that go along with our publications](https://github.com/CooperstoneLab).\n\n## What is GitHub Pages?\n\n[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a tool allows you to host your website directlry from a GitHub repository.\n\n## What is GitHub Desktop?\n\n[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a application that lets you use Git and GitHub in a less-scary-than-working-in-your-terminal way. [Here](https://www.simplilearn.com/how-to-use-github-desktop-tutorial-article) is a longer tutorial on how to use GitHub desktop.\n\n# Set output directory in YAML to docs\n\nThe first thing we want to do, is make a change in your `_quarto.yml` file to what the output directory of the site is, so it is more compatible with GitHub Pages.\n\nGo into your `_quarto.yml` and under `project:`, set `output-dir: docs`, like this:\n\n``` yaml\n---\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n---\n```\n\nWhat this does is change where the compiled website goes.\n\nThere are [three different ways you can publish Quarto websites to GitHub pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html), but the one I am going over here is the simplest.\n\nBe sure to build you page now by going to the Build tab in the top right quadrant, and click Render Website.\n\n![a screenshot of the Build tab in RStudio](img/render-website.png)\n\n# Download Git\n\nIf you don't already have Git, download it: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.\n\n# Create a GitHub account\n\nIn order to connect have your site hosted with GitHub and GitHub Pages, you need a GitHub account.\n\nCreate a GitHub account by going to [github.com/join](https://github.com/join).\n\n![a screenshot of getting a GitHub account](img/create-gh-account.png)\n\nYou will have to pick a username - remember that other people will see this username so use one you'd feel comfortable with. [Here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html) is some advice for picking a username.\n\n# Download GitHub Desktop and link it to your account\n\nWe are going to interface with GitHub via Github Desktop because I think this is the easiest way to do it. It is definitely not the only way.\n\nFirst download GitHub Desktop: <https://desktop.github.com/>\n\nOpen GitHub Desktop and log into your GitHub account.\n\n# Create your website repository on GitHub.com\n\nWe are going to create the repository that will house our website on GitHub using our web browser. Open up a browser and navigate to <https://github.com/new>. Be sure you are logged in.\n\nYou will need to:\n\n-   indicate a repository name - this will be the suffix on your website (mine says it is taken since I had already made the website when I took this screenshot - it will not be this way for you)\n-   provide a description of the repo so someone can know what it contains\n-   make your repo public\n-   add a readme\n\n![a screenshot of adding a GitHub repo](img/gh-repo.png)\n\nI will skip adding the gitignore (a document that tells git which files to ignore when you deploy) and the license but you can add these if you want. Then click the green button at the bottom to `Create repository`.\n\nOnce you have done this you will now have a repo where you can put your website.\n\n# Clone your repository in GitHub Desktop\n\nNow we are going to link this repo with GitHub Desktop.\n\nIn your newly created repo on the GitHub web portal click on the green Code button to copy the HTTPS link to your repo.\n\n![a screenshot of grabbing the HTTPS url for your repo](img/gh-clone-url.png)\n\nWith this link in your clipboard, open up GitHub Desktop and go to `File` \\> `Clone Repository`.\n\nClick the refresh button on the side, and select your newly created repo, and where you want this directory to be. I am going to put this folder inside the directory of my original website, to make copying files over later easy.\n\n![a screenshot of cloning our newly created repo in GitHub desktop](img/gh-desktop-clone-repo.png)\n\n# Move the files from your website project into your new directory\n\nOpen up Finder or Windows Explorer on your computer and navigate to where you have your website directory/new repo. Copy all of the files from your original website directory **except for your .Rproj** and paste them into your repo directory. You should now have all your files together and we will be ready to commit and then push them to GitHub.\n\n# Commit and push your website to GitHub\n\nGo back to GitHub desktop at click the refresh button at the top middle. You should see a bunch of files (all those that comprise your website) under Changes in the tab on the left side.\n\nWe are going to now commit our files along with a comment on what we are doing in the bottom left of GitHub desktop. Once you've written your comment, press Commit to main. This sends your files to your GitHub repo.\n\n![a screenshot of the initial commit in GitHub desktop](img/initial-commit.png)\n\nOnce you've done that, click `Push origin` in the top right. Note that in the screenshot below there are no files indicated under changes, since I've already committed them.\n\n![a screenshot of pushing to origin in GitHub desktop](img/push-origin.png)\n\nNice! Now we should be able to see your website in your GitHub repo. Navigate there in your browser and check. The website files should be there.\n\n![a screenshot of what our repo looks like on GitHub.com](img/gh-repo-created.png)\n\n# Set GitHub Pages to deploy from docs\n\nThe last thing we need to do to get our website to render is to change some settings for GitHub Pages.\n\nIn your repo, click on the Settings button in the top right of the page. Then click on the Pages tab on the left. Under Branch, we want to set our page to:\n\n-   build from main\n-   and render from the /docs folder\n\nThen click Save.\n\n![a screenshot of the settings for GitHub pages to render from docs](img/gh-settings-pages.png)\n\nRefresh your page and you should now be able to visit your site! There will be a link at the top of the page. You did it!! Check out your new site.\n\n![a screenshot of the settings for GitHub pages to render from docs](img/visit-site.png)\n",
