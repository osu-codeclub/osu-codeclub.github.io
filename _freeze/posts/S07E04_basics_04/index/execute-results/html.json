It's fine if you don't know what this means, you will by the end of today's session. We are also going to introduce the idea of a data frame.\n\n## What are vectorized operations?\n\nI think its easier to see 👀 an example of a vectorized operation, and then we can explain what is happening under the hood.\n\nLet's create a vector of high temperatures for the weather in Columbus OH in Fahrenheit from the last 7 days. I took this data from January 19 to 25, 2024.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemps_F <- c(26, 21, 24, 32, 33, 41, 51)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can call our vector to see what it contains.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemps_F\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 26 21 24 32 33 41 51\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA reminder that:\n\n$$\n°F = 1.8 * °C + 32\n$$\n\nWith some light rearrangement, we can write the code below so we can plug in a temp in Fahrenheit, and get out one in Celsius.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemps_C <- (temps_F - 32)/1.8\n\ntemps_C\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -3.3333333 -6.1111111 -4.4444444  0.0000000  0.5555556  5.0000000 10.5555556\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, we simply use the vector `temps_F` as we would any single number in a smple mathematical operation, and we convert each element or number in our our entire vector using the formula we provide. As a result, we can convert every element of our vector from Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n\n> It is worth mentioning that this is *unique in R* - many other programming languages would require a for loop or similar to do this operation, but because R is a **vectorized language**, this works easily and simply.\n\nHere is another example. Imagine you have a vector of values and you want to calculate the log base 2 value for each element.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nraw <- c(20, 36, 42, 53)\n\nlog2 <- log2(raw)\n\nlog2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4.321928 5.169925 5.392317 5.727920\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is an example where we apply a formula transformation to a vector, but we can also use vectorized operations with two vectors.\n\n## Vector by vector operations\n\nLet's create some vectors. Note I am not using the `c()` function to create the vector - since I am using the `:` to indicate a string of integers from number 1 to number 2, under the hood, R automatically makes this a vector. If you were to use the `c()` function though you would get the same result.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a vector with the values from 1 to 10, incrementing by 1\n# vector_1to10 <- c(1:10) would also work\nvector_1to10 <- 1:10\n\nvector_1to5 <- 1:5\n\nvector_1to3 <- 1:3\n\nvector_0to4 <- 0:4\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"What do you think will happen if we try and add `vector_1to10` and `vector_1to5`?\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# a vector reminder\nvector_1to10\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvector_1to5\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# adding\nvector_1to10 + vector_1to5\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1]  2  4  6  8 10  7  9 11 13 15\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that `vector_1to5` gets recycled, meaning once the 5 elements in the vector have been used, the addition starts back from the beginning again. If we want to be explicit:\n\n-   Element 1 of `vector_1to10` gets added to element 1 of `vector_1to5`\n-   Element 2 of `vector_1to10` gets added to element 2 of `vector_1to5`\n-   Element 3 of `vector_1to10` gets added to element 3 of `vector_1to5`\n-   Element 4 of `vector_1to10` gets added to element 4 of `vector_1to5`\n-   Element 5 of `vector_1to10` gets added to element 5 of `vector_1to5`.\n-   Element 6 of `vector_1to10` gets added to **element 1** of `vector_1to5`\n\nand so on...\n\n⚠️ **This happens without R explicitly telling you this is happening.

This is because we have at least one infinite value, so including it as part of a sum makes that sum infinite too.\n\n⚠️ **Think about how this might work if you have NAs in your vector**\n:::\n\n## Filtering vectors\n\nWe can also write code that allows us to filter our vector based on certain conditions. What if we wanted to know which observations had data where the temperature was above freezing? We could use a mathematical operator (in this case, `>`) to find instances when the statement we provide is true.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemps_C > 0\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen we run this code, we get a series of values corresponding to each element of the vector, and whether or not the statement we have prompted with (`temps_C > 0`) is true or false.\n\nIf we wanted to see how many observations meet these criteria, we can take advantage of the fact that `TRUE` is coded as 1, and `FALSE` and 0.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(temps_C > 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe know then that there are 3 observations where the temperature is above freezing.\n\nIf we want to know **which** observations are above freezing, we can use the function [`which()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/which) which shows us the indices of the elements in our vector for which our code evaluates to `TRUE`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhich(temps_C > 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5 6 7\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis tells us that the 5th, 6th, and 7th elements in our data have temperatures higher than freezing. In our vector we don't have the specific days associated with each temperature embedded. We can assign meta-data to our values by using the function [`names()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/names) for our vector. I'll show you how to do that below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a new vector that has the dates we want to assign\ndates <- c(\"1/19\", \"1/20\", \"1/21\", \"1/22\", \"1/23\", \"1/24\", \"1/25\")\n\n# we can assign these dates as the \"names\" of our vector temps_C\nnames(temps_C) <- dates\n\n# now our temps have dates associated with them\ntemps_C\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      1/19       1/20       1/21       1/22       1/23       1/24       1/25 \n-3.3333333 -6.1111111 -4.4444444  0.0000000  0.5555556  5.0000000 10.5555556 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you knew you wanted to do this at the outset, you could create the vector along with its names all at once using the handy function [`structure()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/structure). \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(temps_F_names <- structure(temps_F,\n                           names = dates))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1/19 1/20 1/21 1/22 1/23 1/24 1/25 \n  26   21   24   32   33   41   51 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> You can also set other attributes using the function `structure()`.\n\nYou might use the sometimes, but more likely you would want to work using a data frame.\n\n## Practice\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Create a vector of 10 numbers, beginning at 2, incrementing by 11.

In reality, you will probably be reading your data in from a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file, but you can also construct a data frame directly in R. We are doing this with the function [`data.frame()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/data.frame) which is a part of base R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a simple 3 by 4 data frame called small_df\n# columns are a, b, and c\n# values are numbers from 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 12\nsmall_df <- data.frame(a = 1:4, \n                       b = 5:8, \n                       c = 9:12)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's look at `small_df`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsmall_df\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  a b  c\n1 1 5  9\n2 2 6 10\n3 3 7 11\n4 4 8 12\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can think about a data frame as being composed of a series of vectors (as columns) squished together. In the case above, each column is of the same type, integer or numeric but this doesn't have to be true. Note the first column of 1:4 is actually the row index - you can tell this as it doesn't have a column name.\n\n> Vectors all must be of the same object type (i.e., character, numeric, logical). In a data frame, each column can be a different object type. This is very useful especially when you have to have meta-data combined with numeric data.\n\nWe call use some new functions to look more at our data frame.\n\n`View()` will open our data frame like you might be used to looking at a spreadsheet in Excel.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nView(small_df)\n```\n:::\n\n\n`str()` gives us the structure of the object x.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(small_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n'data.frame':\t4 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ a: int  1 2 3 4\n $ b: int  5 6 7 8\n $ c: int  9 10 11 12\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`dim()` gives us the dimensions of x.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(small_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Note that when referring to a two-dimensional piece of data, R uses the syntax [rows, columns]\"}\n:::\n\nNote, that if you use `dim()` on a vector (which has only one dimension), you will get something unexpected.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# this doesn't work\ndim(temps_C)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nNULL\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor a vector, instead you should use the function `length()` to figure out how many elements are in the vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# this does work\nlength(temps_C)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 7\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Performing operations on a data frame\n\nNow that we have our `small_df` we can try performing some operations on it.\n\nWhat if you wanted to take the log base 2 for every value in `small_df`? Just like we did for a vector, we can simply use the function `log2()` on `small_df`. Here I am assigning the output of this to a new data frame called `small_df_log2`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(small_df_log2 <- log2(small_df))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n         a        b        c\n1 0.000000 2.321928 3.169925\n2 1.000000 2.584963 3.321928\n3 1.584963 2.807355 3.459432\n4 2.000000 3.000000 3.584963\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRemember, if you assign something to an object, but also want it to print at the same time, just surround the whole thing in parentheses.\n\nWhat if I wanted to take the log base 2 of only column `a`? There are a few ways I can do that.\n\n### By indexing\n\nI can use the square brackets `[]` to access certain parts of my data frame. Remember for data frames, the syntax is \\[rows, columns\\]. Let's try some example where we access by using indices (i.e., the position of the row, column, or the combination) to grab different parts of our data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# first row, second column\nsmall_df[1,2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# all rows, second column\nsmall_df[,2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5 6 7 8\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# third row, all columns\nsmall_df[3,]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  a b  c\n3 3 7 11\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIs there any difference as to the types of objects we get when doing these different types of selection?

Note that in this case the column name `a` is in quotes since it is a character string.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# all rows, the column \"a\"\nsmall_df[,\"a\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also use the dollar sign accessor `$` to extract an element in a data frame or list. In the case of a data frame, you are accessing a column (though you could be accessing something else if a different type of object).
