Let's use a dataset we've used before, `gapminder` and I've created some files for you to download.\n\n::: callout-note\nRemember that files with by default be downloaded into your working directory.\n:::\n\nHere is some code to download a file that includes information about the happiness score for each country in the world from 2005-2022.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# download the happiness data\ndownload.file(url = \"https://github.com/jcooperstone/dataviz-site/raw/refs/heads/master/2_04_wrangling/data/hapiscore_whr.csv\",\n              destfile = \"happiness.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd some data on life expectancy around the world from 1800 to predicted values from 2022-2100.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# download the life expectancy data\ndownload.file(url = \"https://github.com/jcooperstone/dataviz-site/raw/refs/heads/master/2_04_wrangling/data/life_expectancy.csv\",\n              destfile = \"life-expectancy.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Tasks to play around with\n\nLet's together work on writing prompts to get R to write to complete each tasks or that answer the following questions:\n\n1. Get R to read in your happiness and life expectancy data\n\n2. Understand what your data contains\n\n3. Which is the country with the highest life expectancy in 2025?\n\n4. Which country increased life expectancy the most from 2000 to 2025?\n\n5. Create a plot that shows the line expectancy in the United States over the time period for which we have data\n\n6. Create a plot that shows the relationship between life expectancy and happiness score in 2022.\n\n\n",
