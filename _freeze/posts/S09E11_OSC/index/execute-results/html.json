There are only a handful of them on each supercomputer, they are shared among everyone, and cannot be \"reserved\".\n\nAs such, login nodes are meant only to do things like organizing your files and creating scripts for compute jobs, and are ***not*** **meant for any serious computing**, which should be done on the compute nodes.\n\n#### Compute Nodes\n\nData processing and analysis is done on compute nodes.\nYou can only use compute nodes after putting in a **request** for resources (a \"job\").\nThe Slurm *job scheduler*, which we will learn to use in week 5, will then assign resources to your request.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### What works differently on a supercomputer like at OSC? _(Click to expand)_\n\nCompared to command-line computing on a laptop or desktop,\na number of aspects are different when working on a supercomputer like at OSC.\nWe'll learn much more about these later on in the course, but here is an overview: \n\n-   **\"Non-interactive\" computing is common**\\\n    It is common to write and \"submit\" scripts to a queue instead of running programs interactively.\n-   **Software**\\\n    You generally can't install \"the regular way\", and a lot of installed software needs to be \"loaded\".\n-   **Operating system**\\\n    Supercomputers run on the Linux operating system.\n-   **Login versus compute nodes**\\\n    As mentioned, the nodes you end up on after logging in are not meant for heavy computing\n    and you have to *request access to \"compute nodes\"* to run most analyses.    \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### OSC file systems _(Click to expand)_\n\nOSC has several distinct file systems:\n\n| File system | Located within | Quota              | Backed up? | Auto-purged?  | One for each... |\n|----------|------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| **Home**        | `/users/`         | 500 GB / 1 M files | Yes        | No            | User            |\n| **Project**     | `/fs/ess/`   | Flexible           | Yes        | No            | OSC Project     |\n| **Scratch**     | `/fs/scratch/`    | 100 TB             | No         | After 90 days | OSC Project     |\n\n_(Directory is just another word for folder, often written as \"dir\" for short.)_\n:::\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n## OSC OnDemand\n\nThe OSC OnDemand web portal allows you to use a web browser to access OSC resources such as:\n\n-   A **file browser** where you can also create and rename folders and files, etc.\n-   A **Unix shell**\n-   \"**Interactive Apps**\": programs such as **_RStudio_**, Jupyter, VS Code and QGIS.\n\n{{< fa user-edit >}} **Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> and log in** (use the boxes on the left-hand side)\n\nYou should see a landing page similar to the one below:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"img/ondemand_home.png\" width=\"90%\"/>\n\n</p>\n\nWe will now go through some of the dropdown menus in the **blue bar along the top**.\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n### Files: File system access\n\nHovering over the **Files** dropdown menu gives a list of directories that you have access to.\nIf your account is brand new, and you were added to `PAS1838`, you should only have three directories listed:\n\n1.  A **Home** directory (starts with `/users/`)\n2.  The `PAS1838` project's \"_scratch_\" directory for temporary project-related storage (`/fs/scratch/PAS1838`) \n3.  The `PAS1838` project's \"_project_\" directory for permanent project-related storage (`/fs/ess/PAS1838`)\n\nYou will only ever have one Home directory at OSC,\nbut for every additional project you are a member of,\nyou should usually see additional `/fs/ess` and `/fs/scratch` directories appear.\n\n{{< fa user-edit >}} **Click on your Home directory**.\n\nOnce there, you should see whichever directories and files are present at the selected location,\nand you can click on the directories to explore the contents further:\n\n![](img/ondemand_files_pas2700.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"95%\"}\n\nThis interface is **much like the file browser on your own computer**, so you can also create, delete, move and copy files and folders, and even upload (from your computer to OSC) and download (from OSC your computer) files^[Though this is not meant for large (\\>1 GB) transfers. Different methods are available --- we'll talk about those later on.] --- see the buttons across the top.\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n### Clusters: Unix shell access\n\nInteracting with a supercomputer is most commonly done using a Unix shell.\nUnder the **Clusters** dropdown menu, you can access a Unix shell either on Owens or Pitzer:\n\n![](img/ondemand_shell_select.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\nI'm selecting a shell on the Pitzer supercomputer (\"Pitzer Shell Access\"),\nwhich will open a new browser tab, where the bottom of the page looks like this:\n\n![](img/ondemand_shell2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"95%\"}\n\nThe \"**Clusters**\" dropdown menu also has item \"**System Status**\".\nWhen you click on that, a new browser tab will open with a page that\nshows an overview of the live, current usage of the clusters ---\nthis can be useful to get an idea of the scale of the supercomputer center,\nwhich cluster is being used more, and so on:\n\n![](img/ondemand_systemstatus.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"90%\"}\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n### Interactive Apps\n\nWe can access programs with Graphical User Interfaces (**GUI**s; point-and-click interfaces)\nvia the **Interactive Apps** dropdown menu:\n\n![](img/ondemand_vscode_select.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"32%\"}\n\n<br>\n\n## RStudio at OSC (RStudio Server)\n\nFrom within our browser,\nwe can access a version of RStudio (\"RStudio Sever\") that will be running on\nOSC's computers.\n\nSome potential advantages of doing this are:\n\n- You can access multiple different versions of R!\n- You have access to OSC's compute power and could easily request say 20 cores\n  or 100 GB of memory (RAM)\n- You have large amounts of data that are stored on OSC anyway, or are best stored there\n\n### Starting an RStudio Server session\n\n1.  Click on **`Interactive Apps`** (top bar) and then **`RStudio Server`** (all the way at the bottom)\n\n2.  Fill out the form as follows:\n\n    -   Cluster: **`Pitzer`**\n    -   R version: **`4.4.0`**\n    -   Project: **`PAS1838`**\n    -   Number of hours: **`1`**\n    -   Node type: **`any`**\n    -   Number of cores: **`1`**\n\n<details><summary>*Click to see a screenshot*</summary>\n\n![](img/rstudio_form.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n</details>\n\n4.  Click the big blue **`Launch`** button at the bottom\n\n5.  Now, you should be sent to a new page with a box at the top for your RStudio Server \"job\",\n    which should initially be \"Queued\" (waiting to start).\n\n<details><summary>*Click to see a screenshot*</summary>\n\n![](img/rstudio_queued.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n</details>\n\n6.  Your job should start running very soon, with the top bar of the box turning green and saying \"Running\".\n\n<details><summary>*Click to see a screenshot*</summary>\n\n![](img/rstudio_running.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n</details>\n\n7.  Click **`Connect to RStudio Server`** at the bottom of the box,\n    and an RStudio Server instance will open in a new browser tab. You're ready to go!\n\n### Installing R packages\n\nYou can install R packages as usual with `install.packages()` and related functions:\nthese will automatically be installed in your default personal library somewhere\nin your Home directory.\n\n<br>\n",
