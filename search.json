    "text": "1 Miscellaneous R tips\n\n1.1 Installing R packages\n\nCRAN packages\nTo install an R package that is available at CRAN, the default R package repository, from within R (e.g.¬†in the R console in RStudio), use the install.packages() function.\nThe install.packages() function will handle dependencies within R ‚Äî i.e., it will install other R packages that your package depends on. Occasionally, when the install function needs to compile a package from source, errors arise that relate to missing system dependencies (i.e.¬†software outside of R).\nOn Mac and Linux, these system dependencies are best installed outside of R, such as with homebrew on Mac or apt on Ubuntu. The errror message you got when trying to install an R package should tell you which system dependencies are needed.\nOn Windows, you can use the installr package to install such dependencies or other software from within R ‚Äî for example:\ninstall.packages(\"installr\")    # Install the installr package first\ninstalllr::install.RStudio()    # Install RStudio\ninstallr::install.python()      # Install Python\n\n\nInstalling packages from Github\nTo install a package from Github, use either the devtools or the remotes package ‚Äì for example:\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")                # Install the remotes package\nremotes::install_github(\"kbroman/broman\")  # Install from a repository using \"&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;\"\nThis will install the package from source, so you will need to make sure you are able to do so by following the instructions in the section right above this one."

    "text": "2 What is the tidyverse?\n‚ÄúThe tidyverse‚Äù is a collection of packages called that are designed for data science. You can certainly use R without using the tidyverse, but it has many packages that I think will make your life a lot easier. We will be using mostly tidyverse functions in this class, with some base R syntax scattered throughout.\n\n\n\nFigure from teachdatascience.com\n\n\nThe ‚Äúcore tidyverse‚Äù contains the 8 packages below:\n\ndplyr: for data manipulation\nggplot2: a ‚Äúgrammar of graphics‚Äù for creating beautiful plots\nreadr: for reading in rectangular data (i.e., Excel-style formatting)\ntibble: using tibbles as modern/better dataframes\nstringr: handling strings (i.e., text or stuff in quotes)\nforcats: for handling categorical variables (i.e., factors) (meow!)\ntidyr: to make ‚Äútidy data‚Äù\npurrr: for enhancing functional programming (also meow!)\n\nWe will be using many of these other packages in Code Club and we will talk about them as we go. There are more tidyverse packages outside of these core eight, and we will talk about some of them another time.\n\ntl;dr Tidyverse has a lot of packages that make data analysis easier. None of them are required, but I think you‚Äôll find many tidyverse approaches easier and more intuitive than using base R."

    "text": "3 Installing new packages\nSo far, we have used only functions and data that exist within ‚Äúbase R‚Äù - or the portion of R that comes with the default install. R is an open source language, meaning people all around the world can develop tools that can be used within R. These tools are always evolving, and there are way too many of them for them to all come pre-downloaded.\nThese tools mostly live within something called a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù. You can think about a package as a unit of code that can be shared and reused. These packages can include both functions and data. A person (or team) can create a package, make that available for download, and then anyone can use it.\nTo install packages in R that are on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), you can use the function install.packages(). There are packages that are not on CRAN but we are not going to talk about them today. Be sure that you provide the name of your packages as a string, and put it in quotes.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")"

I try and remember to use the new one but it doesn‚Äôt always happen, so do be familiar with both.\nYou can go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code and make sure the tick mark is checked next to ‚ÄúUse the native pipe operator, |&gt; (requires R 4.1+).\n\nOf course you can assign the output of a pipe to something using the assignment operator &lt;- and then use it for other things.\nSsome functions are not ‚Äúpipe friendly‚Äù meaning they will not work using pipes. This is often because the data is not the first argument passed to the function. All tidyverse functions work with piping."

You should use this option as it will help prevent misspellings. You can also hit tab to scroll through all the potential objects to select.\nWe can also select by index.

We can either calculate the values we want to map to the error bars, and then add them, or use another stat_summary() to have ggplot2 calculate the values for us. I will show you code for both, but only go through doing this manually (as the other way is a little bit more complicated than I want to get into right now).how to do both.\nJust like we used summarize() to calculate the means, we can also use similar code to calculate a standard deviation.

And we can plot this now.\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, \n                                  na.rm = TRUE), # remove missing values\n            sd_body_mass = sd(body_mass_g,\n                              na.rm = TRUE), # remove missing values\n            .by = island) |&gt; # summarize by island\n  ggplot(aes(x = island, y = mean_body_mass)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = (mean_body_mass - sd_body_mass), # set min\n                    ymax = (mean_body_mass + sd_body_mass)), # set max\n                width = 0.2) # set width of the bars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can have ggplot() make your error bars for you but it‚Äôs a little more complicated than what I want to get into.

    "text": "2 The ggplot philosophy\nWe have seen that in R, instead of manually manipulating data with a mouse as you do when editing Excel spreadsheets, we code the operations we want to perform, e.g.¬†using dplyr verbs like select(). In a similar way, when performing visualization, instead of clicking on a chart type, we code the chart in R.\nAnd just as dplyr gives us efficient ways to manipulate data frames, ggplot2 (which is also part of the tidyverse) gives us efficient ways to manipulate charts/plots/graphics1. The gg in ggplot2 stands for grammar of graphics, a systematic approach for designing statistical plots. The idea is to ‚Äòpull apart‚Äô various plots into their component pieces, which leads to the idea of layers.\nThere‚Äôs a learning curve to such a systematic approach, but there are many advantages:\n\nFirst, every graphic shares a common template. Once you understand this structure you can ‚Äúsay‚Äù a lot of different things. The ggplot cheat sheet lists over 40 plot-types, but because ggplot is somewhat of a language in its own right, users can create their own extensions that you can also utilize, adding many more.\nSecond, because plots are built up using layers, you can gradually build up a graphic of increasing complexity; or on the other hand, take someone else‚Äôs code and simplify it by deleting layers. We add layers with + very similar to how we‚Äôve been piping operations with |&gt;.\nThird, and this is a more general point that applies to a lot of R code: because the graphic is now a piece of code, it is reusable. Once you have a little library of graphs you‚Äôve made, you can tweak them in various ways to make more. You can also share your code with others, so they can apply the same approach to their data."

    "text": "4 A first ggplot2 example\nWhat is the correlation between bill-length and bill-width in these penguin species? Are longer bills also deeper? We can explore this with a scatterplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA first plot attempt\nThe first thing that ggplot2 plot needs from you is a data frame ‚Äî just like the rest of the tidyverse, ggplot2 is oriented towards data frames. Specifically, the first argument to the ggplot() function is a data frame:\n\nggplot(data = penguins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not very interesting! But it‚Äôs notable that it is something. ggplot() has created a base plot layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the name of the package is ggplot2, the name of the function is just ggplot().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first complete plot\nOur initial plotting code was correct but incomplete. Next, we need to specify:\n\nThe plot type we want using one of many ‚Äúgeom‚Äù functions ‚Äî e.g., the geom for a scatterplot is geom_point().\nWhich columns in our data frame to plot in which ways, such along the x and y axes. In ggplot-speak, we are mapping variables to aesthetics, with the aesthetics being things like x and y coordinates as well shape and color.\n\nWe can add both these pieces of information in a single additional layer. The operator to add a layer is +, which is the ggplot equivalent of the pipe symbol (|&gt;), and best practice is to place it at the end of the line, just like the pipe. Here then is our complete first plot:\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo recap, the three required ggplot elements that we used are:\n\nThe data: here penguins\nOne or more geoms: here geom_point()\nOne or more aesthetic mappings: here x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm\n\nAlso, note that we provided three pieces of information from our data ‚Äî a data frame and two column names. After telling ggplot to use the penguins data frame, we can refer to columns in this data frame using their unquoted names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot warning above\n\n\n\nggplot warned us that 2 rows were removed because they ‚Äúcontaining missing values or values outside the scale range‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄúMissing values‚Äù: If this were the case, there must be NAs in the bill length and/or bill depth columns.\n‚ÄúOutside the scale range‚Äù: This could happen if we manually set a ‚Äúscale range‚Äù, e.g.¬†restricting axis limits so some of the data can‚Äôt be plotted. We didn‚Äôt do this and ggplot wouldn‚Äôt automatically do it, so this doesn‚Äôt apply.\n\nSo, there are probably NAs ‚Äî let‚Äôs look for those, starting with the bill length column:\n\npenguins |&gt; filter(is.na(bill_length_mm))\n\n# A tibble: 2 √ó 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen             NA            NA                NA          NA\n2 Gentoo  Biscoe                NA            NA                NA          NA\n# ‚Ñπ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nWe indeed get two rows, with NAs for all measurement, so those must have been the two rows ggplot was complaining about.\n\n\nAs for the relationship between bill length and bill depth ‚Äî this is not very clear, but I guess if you squint your eyes, you can see local positive correlations? We‚Äôll explore this relationship in more detail below.\n\n\n\nEach point in the plot has a bill length and an associated bill depth. How does ggplot know which bill lengths to associate with which bill depths? (Click for the answer)\n\n\nEach point comes from one row in the data frame: so ggplot assumes that the the bill length and bill depth given in one row derive from the same observation (here: the same penguin).\nAs such, to work with ggplot, your data frame needs to be in a ‚Äútidy‚Äù format (see our Code Club from a couple weeks ago). If you find yourself struggling to appropriately assign aesthetic mappings, you may have to pivot your data first, most often with a pivot_longer().\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1\nCreate a scatterplot comparing body mass and flipper length. Does it look like there is any correlation there?\n\n\nHints (click here)\n\nTake another look at the penguins data frame to see which columns contain body mass and flipper length. It‚Äôs up to you which you assign to the x axis and the y axis.\n\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm))"

    "text": "5 The power of aesthetics\nWe saw above that the relationship between bill length and bill depth is not particularly clear, but that there might be some local patterns. Is it possible that these clusters correspond somehow to the three different penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo? That is, part of the problem with our original plot may be that we lumped the data from all three species together.\nWe can explore this by adding a third aesthetic, color. Our current plot maps bill_length_mm to the x aesthetic, and bill_depth_mm to the y aesthetic ‚Äî now, we‚Äôll add a mapping of species to the color aesthetic:\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                           y = bill_depth_mm,\n                           color = species))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that a legend is added automatically!

However, it is possible to add multiple geoms in ggplot ‚Äî and once you do that, the following becomes important:\n\nMappings provided to a specific geom are ‚Äúlocal‚Äù: they do not carry over to other geoms.\nMappings provided to ggplot() are ‚Äúglobal‚Äù: they apply to all geoms in the plot.\n\nTherefore, if you have multiple geoms, it most often makes sense to put the aesthetics inside ggplot(), but there are exceptions ‚Äî and it is also possible to specify aesthetics in multiple places.

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nSo far in code club this semester, all of the data we have used has been either made up by us or able to be loading from data embedded within base R or a package.\nToday we are going to go over reading in external data into R. The tidyverse core package that contains functions for reading in (and writing out) data is readr and readxl allows reading in Excel data. This package allows us to read in rectangular data. Some of the material from today is adapted from a past code club by Jelmer Poelstra.\nUseful references for today:\n\nreadr documentation (for reading in delimited files)\nreadxl docuemtation (for reading in Excel files)\nData import with the tidyverse cheatsheet\nData import chapter 7 in R for Data Science\n\nThere are other non-core tidyverse packages for reading in data (including directly from Google Drive), you can find them here though I will not go through them today.\nWe are going to use a new package today.\n\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")\n\nAnd then will start by loading the libraries we need for today.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nBut before we actually read in data, let‚Äôs talk a little bit about the different ways in which input data can be formatted."

    "section": "2 What are some common data formatting styles?",
    "text": "2 What are some common data formatting styles?\n\n2.1 .csv\nThe most common formatting style for data is comma separated values, which often has the file extension .csv. This means that the data is delimited (i.e., separated) by commas. Often we open these files in a program like Excel, Numbers, or similar, which puts each value into its own cell, but the data actually looks like this:\nStudent ID,Full Name,favourite.food,mealPlan,AGE\n1,Sunil Huffmann,Strawberry yoghurt,Lunch only,4\n2,Barclay Lynn,French fries,Lunch only,5\n3,Jayendra Lyne,N/A,Breakfast and lunch,7\n4,Leon Rossini,Anchovies,Lunch only,\n5,Chidiegwu Dunkel,Pizza,Breakfast and lunch,five\n6,G√ºven√ß Attila,Ice cream,Lunch only,6\nHere, the first row are our column headers, and each subsequent row contains information about one student, including their student ID, full name, favorite food, meal plan, and age.\nIf we look at this data as a table, it looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent ID\nFull Name\nfavourite.food\nmealPlan\nAGE\n\n\n\n\n1\nSunil Huffmann\nStrawberry yoghurt\nLunch only\n4\n\n\n2\nBarclay Lynn\nFrench fries\nLunch only\n5\n\n\n3\nJayendra Lyne\nN/A\nBreakfast and lunch\n7\n\n\n4\nLeon Rossini\nAnchovies\nLunch only\nNA\n\n\n5\nChidiegwu Dunkel\nPizza\nBreakfast and lunch\nfive\n\n\n6\nG√ºven√ß Attila\nIce cream\nLunch only\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 .tsv\nAnother common data format is as tab separated values, or .tsv. Here, instead of being separated by commas like in a .csv, the values are separated by tabs. Looking at the same students data in a .tsv format would look like this:\nStudent ID        Full Name        favourite.food        mealPlan        AGE\n1        Sunil Huffmann        Strawberry yoghurt        Lunch only        4\n2        Barclay Lynn        French fries        Lunch only        5\n3        Jayendra Lyne        N/A        Breakfast and lunch        7\n4        Leon Rossini        Anchovies        Lunch only        \n5        Chidiegwu Dunkel        Pizza        Breakfast and lunch        five\n6        G√ºven√ß Attila        Ice cream        Lunch only        6\n\nBoth comma-separated nad tab-separated values can also be stored with other file extensions like .txt.\n\n\n\n2.3 .xlsx and .xls\nThese are Microsoft-specific file formats created using the program Excel. Since using Excel spreadsheets so so common, there are special packages that allow the reading in of these file types. If you open up a file in Excel, you can save it in a variety of different file formats, just please do this with care, as Excel has reputation of turning gene names in to dates.\n\n\n2.4 Which file format to use?\nThe truth is all file formats can be read into R, and some might be better for certain instances. You might read on the internet that its better to use .csv files over .xlsx. and .xls for compatibility sake, but there are also benefits to Excel formats where lots of data can be stored in one file in different sheets.\n\nPick the data format that works best for your application."

We can specify that column should be a factor using the argument col_types =. The short codes you can specify in can be found here.\n\nstudents_csv_mealplan &lt;- read_csv(\"students.csv\",\n                             col_types = \"nccfc\")\n\nglimpse(students_csv_mealplan)\n\nRows: 6\nColumns: 5\n$ `Student ID`   &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n$ `Full Name`    &lt;chr&gt; \"Sunil Huffmann\", \"Barclay Lynn\", \"Jayendra Lyne\", \"Leo‚Ä¶\n$ favourite.food &lt;chr&gt; \"Strawberry yoghurt\", \"French fries\", \"N/A\", \"Anchovies‚Ä¶\n$ mealPlan       &lt;fct&gt; Lunch only, Lunch only, Breakfast and lunch, Lunch only‚Ä¶\n$ AGE            &lt;chr&gt; \"4\", \"5\", \"7\", NA, \"five\", \"6\"\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Setting column names\nYou might have a datafile that doesn‚Äôt include headers, or column names. These functions by default use col_names = TRUE and assume that your file does have headers. If you don‚Äôt, you can set this argument to FALSE and provide column headers. Let‚Äôs just try reading in a file without headers just to see what the result is.\n\nstudents_no_headers &lt;- read_csv(\"students_noheader.csv\")\n\nRows: 5 Columns: 5\n‚îÄ‚îÄ Column specification ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): Sunil Huffmann, Strawberry yoghurt, Lunch only, 4\ndbl (1): 1\n\n‚Ñπ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\n‚Ñπ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(students_no_headers)\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 5\n    `1` `Sunil Huffmann` `Strawberry yoghurt` `Lunch only`        `4`  \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;\n1     2 Barclay Lynn     French fries         Lunch only          5    \n2     3 Jayendra Lyne    N/A                  Breakfast and lunch 7    \n3     4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies            Lunch only          &lt;NA&gt; \n4     5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza                Breakfast and lunch five \n5     6 G√ºven√ß Attila    Ice cream            Lunch only          6    \n\n\nWe can see that the first row has become the column names, and this is not what we want.

In the case that you want to read in data that has non-data rows, you can indicate those to skip in the reading in process.\n\n\nstudents_metadata &lt;- read_delim(\"students_with_meta.csv\",\n                                delim = \",\",\n                                skip = 2) # since there are two lines we don't want to read in\n\nRows: 6 Columns: 5\n‚îÄ‚îÄ Column specification ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): Full Name, favourite.food, mealPlan, AGE\ndbl (1): Student ID\n\n‚Ñπ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\n‚Ñπ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(students_metadata)\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 5\n  `Student ID` `Full Name`      favourite.food     mealPlan            AGE  \n         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;\n1            1 Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only          4    \n2            2 Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only          5    \n3            3 Jayendra Lyne    N/A                Breakfast and lunch 7    \n4            4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only          &lt;NA&gt; \n5            5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch five \n6            6 G√ºven√ß Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only          6    \n\n\nThis is particularly useful if you are reading in data that comes off an instrument or system that formats data in a specific way.\n\n\n6.4 What to do with NAs\nOften your dataset will have missing data, though different people will code NAs differently. They may be simply missing, N/A, 999, or in some other way. You can tell your data import function how NAs are coded so they can be parsed correctly.\nIn this data, we have NAs that are coded as ‚ÄúNA‚Äù, and ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù. The default NA values are R are na = c(\"NA\", \"\"), so our data deviates from what would by default be considered missing.\n\nstudents_missing &lt;- read_csv(\"students.csv\",\n                             na = c(\"NA\", \"N/A\", \"\")) # adding N/A as a NA option\n\nRows: 6 Columns: 5\n‚îÄ‚îÄ Column specification ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): Full Name, favourite.food, mealPlan, AGE\ndbl (1): Student ID\n\n‚Ñπ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\n‚Ñπ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(students_missing)\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 5\n  `Student ID` `Full Name`      favourite.food     mealPlan            AGE  \n         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;\n1            1 Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only          4    \n2            2 Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only          5    \n3            3 Jayendra Lyne    &lt;NA&gt;               Breakfast and lunch 7    \n4            4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only          &lt;NA&gt; \n5            5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch five \n6            6 G√ºven√ß Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only          6"

    "text": "3 The Absolute Power of Aesthetics\n\n\n\nAesthetics enable us to showcase multiple dimensions of our dataset in a single plot by modifying elements such as color, shape, size, labels, and transparency.\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Last week‚Äôs example on ‚ÄúThe power of aesthetics‚Äù\nLast week we added a third aesthetic to our graph, color. Our current plot mapped bill_length_mm to the x aesthetic, and bill_depth_mm to the y aesthetic ‚Äî , we then added a mapping of species to the color aesthetic:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                           y = bill_depth_mm,\n                           color = species))\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that we begin by using our data set to create a plot object with the function ggplot(). We then assign this object to the variable p. From this point forward, we can add layers by using the + operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 What if we want to customize our plot?\nWe can do this using theme(). There are several options of themes which control all non-data display. Use theme() if you just need to tweak the display of an existing theme.\nFor this session, let‚Äôs utilize theme_bw().\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data = penguins) + theme_bw() +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                           y = bill_depth_mm,\n                           color = species))\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 What if we want to change colors?\nWe can manually change colors.\n\n# Manual color change\n# By using scale_colour_manual(),\n# we can specify the exact colours we want to use\np + \nscale_color_manual(\n  # Note that the color order will correspond to\n  # the order of the species given in the legend\n  values = c(\"grey55\", \"orange\", \"skyblue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using the colors() function, you can explore numerous color options that are available for selection.\n\n\n3.4 Using a different color palette: RColorBrewer\nThere is a wide variety of R color packages specifically designed to offer a range of color palette options, each evoking a distinct mood. For instance, the RColorBrewer package provides a choice of 35 palettes!\nAt this point, you have become an expert in the fundamentals of R. Installing packages and loading them with library() is now second nature to you.\nNow, we can install RColorBrewer and choose one from the many palettes it offers.\n\nRColorBrewer::display.brewer.all(type = \"qual\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, you can observe the organization of the colors into distinct groups based on their sequential, diverging, or mixed characteristics. It is important to note that varied palettes are advantageous for varying data types.\nLet‚Äôs use these palettes with our original penguin graph. Here is an example demonstrating how the Set1 palette is utilized to group data points with the function scale_color_brewer() and the palette argument.\n\np + \nscale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the ggplot2 package offers other functions. Two such functions are scale_color_viridis() and scale_color_grey(), which allows us to convert colors to grayscale without sacrificing information. This is especially important for individuals with colorblindness.\n\np + \nscale_color_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that when using scale_color_viridis() to color data points, we need to specify whether our variable is continuous [using scale_color_viridis_c()] or discrete [using scale_color_viridis_d()]. In this case, the variable species is discrete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1\n\nLet us revisit the scatter plot depicting the correlation between bill length and depth, distinguished by different species using colored data points.\nWhat if we want to use only a grayscale palette for publication purposes?\n\n\n\nHints (click here)\n\nWe can use the scale_color_grey() function to color our grouped data points.\n\n\n\nSolutions (click here)\n\n\np + \nscale_color_grey()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Colorblind-friendly palettes\nHave you ever contemplated how your figure might appear when viewed by individuals with different types of color blindness? We can utilize the colorBlindness package to explore this aspect.\nLet‚Äôs install the colorBlindness package and load it.\n\n# Let's install the colorBlindness package\ninstall.packages(\"colorBlindness\")\nlibrary(colorBlindness)\n\nTo begin with, let‚Äôs test out various colors using the cvdPlot() function. This will demonstrate how our current plot appears to individuals with different types of color blindness.\n\ncolorBlindness::cvdPlot(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur current color palette is not accessible, as can be observed. However, by using viridis palettes, we can ensure that our plots consistently convey the same information, regardless of the audience.\nLet‚Äôs use the same viridis palette we used above to make our plot more accessible.\n\np_viridis &lt;- p + \nscale_color_viridis_d()\n\nWere we successful? Let‚Äôs use cvdPlot() to check again.\n\ncolorBlindness::cvdPlot(p_viridis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Providing transparency with alpha\nHow can we incorporate transparency into the data points in our graph? One way to achieve this is by utilizing the alpha feature.\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, \n                                        y = bill_depth_mm, \n                                        color = species))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we present an example of how to utilize the alpha function to incorporate transparency into our data points. By doing so, we are able to exhibit four variables within a single graph.\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                           y = bill_depth_mm,\n                           color = species,\n                           alpha = flipper_length_mm))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2\n\nWe like the graph we produced above. We want, however, to also display body_mass_g.\nHow can we add this additional variable to our graph?\n\n\n\nHints (click here)\n\nWe can use the size function within aes().\n\n\n\nSolutions (click here)\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                           y = bill_depth_mm,\n                           color = species,\n                           alpha = flipper_length_mm,\n                           size = body_mass_g))"

In this case, the variable species is discrete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1\n\nLet us revisit the scatter plot depicting the correlation between bill length and depth, distinguished by different species using colored data points.\nWhat if we want to use only a grayscale palette for publication purposes?\n\n\n\nHints (click here)\n\nWe can use the scale_color_grey() function to color our grouped data points.\n\n\n\nSolutions (click here)\n\n\np + \nscale_color_grey()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Colorblind-friendly palettes\nHave you ever contemplated how your figure might appear when viewed by individuals with different types of color blindness? We can utilize the colorBlindness package to explore this aspect.\nLet‚Äôs install the colorBlindness package and load it.\n\n# Let's install the colorBlindness package\ninstall.packages(\"colorBlindness\")\nlibrary(colorBlindness)\n\nTo begin with, let‚Äôs test out various colors using the cvdPlot() function. This will demonstrate how our current plot appears to individuals with different types of color blindness.\n\ncolorBlindness::cvdPlot(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur current color palette is not accessible, as can be observed. However, by using viridis palettes, we can ensure that our plots consistently convey the same information, regardless of the audience.\nLet‚Äôs use the same viridis palette we used above to make our plot more accessible.\n\np_viridis &lt;- p + \nscale_color_viridis_d()\n\nWere we successful? Let‚Äôs use cvdPlot() to check again.\n\ncolorBlindness::cvdPlot(p_viridis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Providing transparency with alpha\nHow can we incorporate transparency into the data points in our graph? One way to achieve this is by utilizing the alpha feature.\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, \n                                        y = bill_depth_mm, \n                                        color = species))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we present an example of how to utilize the alpha function to incorporate transparency into our data points. By doing so, we are able to exhibit four variables within a single graph.\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                           y = bill_depth_mm,\n                           color = species,\n                           alpha = flipper_length_mm))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2\n\nWe like the graph we produced above. We want, however, to also display body_mass_g.\nHow can we add this additional variable to our graph?\n\n\n\nHints (click here)\n\nWe can use the size function within aes().\n\n\n\nSolutions (click here)\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                           y = bill_depth_mm,\n                           color = species,\n                           alpha = flipper_length_mm,\n                           size = body_mass_g))"

Within that folder:\n\nThe docs folder contains HTML and other files representing your rendered website\nEverything else (.qmd, .yml etc.) is the source code for your website\n\nIn the workflow we are showing you here, you‚Äôre modifying the files in your working directory predominantly using RStudio.\n\n\nYour local Git repo (bottom left in the illustration) contains one or more saved snapshots (versions through time) of your working directory.\nThe most recent snapshot of the local repo does not necessarily correspond to the state of your working directory: there is purposefully no auto-saving, so saving a snapshot (i.e.¬†commiting) is something you always have to actively do2.\nSaving a snapshot of the current state of your working dir can be done in a number of ways, such as using Git commands in a terminal (the add and commit verbs in the illustration) or using the Git pane in RStudio, but the method we have shown you here uses the GitHub Desktop app.\n\n\nYour remote GitHub repo (top in the illustration) is simply the online counterpart of your local repo.\nJust like changes to your working dir aren‚Äôt automatically saved to your local repo, new snapshots in your local repo aren‚Äôt automatically published to your remote repo: to do so, we have to push our changes online. (The counterpart to push is pull, which we won‚Äôt talk more about here, will pull in changes from the online repo to your local repo.3)\nJust like for committing, we will use GitHub Desktop to push our changes online.\nWe ‚Äúactivated‚Äù the website area last week using some settings for the online repo. Therefore, we don‚Äôt have to think much about this aspect ‚Äì there basically is an automatic connection between the remote repo and the website: GitHub will detect whenever we‚Äôve changed our online repo, and will update the website for us.\n\nIn summary, when you have made changes to your website that you would like to put online, go to GitHub Desktop to save a snapshot to your local repo (i.e., to commit) and then push those changes to your remote (online) repo. GitHub will then detect the changes to your online repo and update your website.\nWe will practice this routine today."

You, too, can change your website‚Äôs URL so that it only contains your GitHub username.\n\nIf you‚Äôre making a personal website, you‚Äôll likely want to make this change.\nIf you‚Äôre making a website covering a specific topic or project, and could see yourself making other similar websites, this URL change doesn‚Äôt make as much sense.\n\nHow can you get such an URL for your website?

Besides the About section, this is another customary way you can make it clear to people that visit your repo on GitHub, what this repo is all about.\nUnlike the changes we made so far today (our website URL, the About info), creating a README file will actually modify the contents of our repo. Therefore, it will be easiest to create this file on our own computer, commit it to our local repo, and push the changes to the remote repo4.\n\nYour turn: Create a README file for your website‚Äôs repo\n\nSwitch to your RStudio window with your website RStudio project open, then click on ‚ÄúFile‚Äù =&gt; ‚ÄúNew File‚Äù =&gt; ‚ÄúMarkdown File‚Äù (halfway down).\nIf the new file doesn‚Äôt automatically open in ‚ÄúVisual‚Äù mode, you can click the ‚ÄúVisual‚Äù button to do so, unless you would like to practice with Markdown syntax.\nSave the file straight away as README.md, in the top-level folder where you also have, e.g., the _quarto.yml file.\nAdd some text to the file, which can be as long or short as you want; you‚Äôll mostly just want to make it clear (again) that this repo is the source for your website. For example, I‚Äôll add for this practice website:\n\n## This is the repository for a practice website part of OSU's Code Club\n\n- OSU Code Club: &lt;https://osu-codeclub.github.io&gt;\n\n- OSU Code Club practice website: &lt;https://osu-codeclub.github.io/practice-website&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour README plain Markdown file\n\n\n\n\nThe ‚ÄúREADME‚Äù in the filename doesn‚Äôt have to be in all-caps, but this is customary.\nThe .md extension stands for (plain) Markdown, as opposed to Quarto Markdown (.qmd) or R Markdown (.Rmd). The difference between plain Markfown and Quarto/R Markdown files is that the latter can execute code (usually but not limited to R code).\nAn interesting side note is that the conversion of a .qmd/.Rmd file to the final output file (HTML in our case, could e.g.¬†also be PDF) takes place in two steps: first, it is rendered to .md, which is then rendered to the final output format."

If you‚Äôre making a bunch of plots, and want all them to have a specific theme, it can be more convenient to set the plotting theme upfront for all plots in your current R session ‚Äî you can do so with the theme_set() function:\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\nOne other tidbit worth pointing out is that you can set the ‚Äúbase size‚Äù for a theme, which is the relative size of the text and lines. You may have noticed that the ggplot‚Äôs font size of e.g.¬†axis labels and titles is relatively small. Instead of changing all of these individually with arguments to theme(), you can use the base_size argument when specifying the overall theme:\n\n# (The default base_size is 11)\ntheme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 12))\n\nFinally, you can set any theme() arguments for all plots in the R session with theme_update() ‚Äî for example, we may want to turn off the minor grid lines:\n\ntheme_update(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\nAfter doing this, as you‚Äôll see, all plots in this session will feature theme_bw without minor grid lines."

In ggplot, such subplots are called ‚Äúfacets‚Äù, and there are two functions to split a plot into facets: facet_wrap() and facet_grid().\nLet‚Äôs start with facet_wrap(). Facets are added as an additional layer to the plot, and in the faceting function, you specify one or more variables to split the plot into separate panels by. Here, we want to facet by species:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  # Add the facet_wrap layer:\n  facet_wrap(~species) +\n  # We still color by species to make the plot look nicer, but no longer need a legend:\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet_wrap() syntax\n\n\n\nNote how the variable to facet by is specified: with a tilde (~) in front, which is R‚Äôs way of specifying formulas. We‚Äôre basically saying to split the plot ‚Äúas a function of‚Äù (by) species. An alternative way of specifying the variable is by wrapping the variable name in vars(), e.g.¬†facet_wrap(vars(species)).\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example with two variables\nIn the above example, you may reasonably prefer either of the two plots we made. For example, perhaps you aren‚Äôt convinced by the faceting solution because you thought the overlapping points in the first plot were useful to make clear how similar Adelie and Chinstrap penguins are in body mass and flipper length.\nWhat may be a more straightforward example of the usefulness of faceting is a situation in which we want to show two or more categorical variables in a plot, like species and island below:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm,\n             color = species, shape = island)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot isn‚Äôt clear at all! Let‚Äôs facet by island to get a much better plot:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~island) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1\nA) Create a scatter plot of bill length vs.¬†bill depth with points colored by sex, and the plot faceted by species.\n\n\n(Click for the answer)\n\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~species) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB) Say that you didn‚Äôt want the species side-by-side (1 row, 3 columns), but stacked vertically (3 rows, 1 column). Take a look at the help page for facet_wrap() (type ?facet_wrap) and try to figure out how you can do this.\n\n\n(Click for the answer)\n\nYou can use the ncol and/or nrow arguments to force a specific number of rows and or columns. The easiest solution here is to merely set the number of columns to 1, which will make facet_wrap() use multiple columns instead:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2\nIn our first example, we faceted because there was too much overlap between points. You may also want to facet for the opposite reason, when differences by some variable are so large that the plot suffers from it. Let‚Äôs artificially create such a situation by increasing the bill lengths for Chinstrap penguins by 100 mm each:\n\npenguins_ed &lt;- penguins |&gt;\n  mutate(bill_length_mm = ifelse(species == \"Chinstrap\",\n                                 bill_length_mm + 100,\n                                 bill_length_mm))\n\nAnd plot this modified data:\n\npenguins_ed |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, the spread along the x axis (bill length) is so large that it has become hard to see the relationship between bill length and bill depth. Let‚Äôs facet:\n\npenguins_ed |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~species) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat didn‚Äôt solve anything yet! But when you facet, you can have the axis ranges (‚Äúscales‚Äù) vary independently between facets. This can be done with the scales argument to facet_wrap(). Take a look at the help page and try to get the x-axis range to be able to differ between the facets.\n\n\n(Click for the answer)\n\nYou‚Äôll want to set scales to free_x:\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  mutate(bill_length_mm = ifelse(species == \"Chinstrap\",\n                                 bill_length_mm + 100,\n                                 bill_length_mm)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~species, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 3\nIn your theme_set() call, vary the value of base_size and take a look at its effect by recreating the plots you made above a few times."

    "text": "5 Multi-panel figures with patchwork\nThe patchwork package allows you to combine multiple plots into a single multi-panel figure.\nThis is something you might be used to doing with programs like Powerpoint or Illustrator. But certainly if all the individual plots that should make up a figure are made with R, it is highly beneficial to combine them in R as well. One of the advantages of using R is that you can easily rerun your code to recreate plots with some modifications, but if after any change, you have to put plots together in another program, you lose some of the advantages related to automation and reproducibility.\nLet‚Äôs install and then load the package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"patchwork\")\n\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nPatchwork assumes that you have created and saved the individual plots as separate R objects. Then, you tell patchwork how to arrange these plots, and the syntax to define the layout is based on common mathematical operators. Some examples, where plot1, plot2, and plot3 represent plots that have been saved as objects with those names:\n\nplot1 | plot2 puts two plots side-by-side\nplot1 / plot2 stacks two plots vertically\nplot1 / (plot2 | plot3) gives plot1 on a top row, and plots 2 and 3 on a bottom row\n\nBelow is an example from palmerpenguins. First we create the plots, saving each as a new object:\n\np_scatter &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(\"species\")\np_scatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np_bar &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  summarize(bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), .by = island) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = island, y = bill_length)) +\n  geom_col()\np_bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np_box &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  drop_na() |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\np_box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we simply use the patchwork syntax to define how these 3 plots will be arranged. In this case, the first (faceted) plot on top, with the other two side-by-side below it:\n\np_scatter / (p_bar | p_box)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatchwork has quite a lot more functionality, and this is very well explained in various vignettes/tutorials on its website. Here, we‚Äôll just try one more feature, adding tags for the individual plots ‚Äî where we tell patchwork about the type of numbering we would like (e.g.¬†A-B-C vs.¬†1-2-3) by specifying the first character:\n\np_scatter / (p_bar | p_box) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 5\nUse the palmerpenguins data to try to create the plot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Click for the answer)\n\n\np_bill_flipper &lt;- penguins |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~species) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\", y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\")\n  \np_mass_yr &lt;- penguins |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Body Mass (g)\")\n\np_bill_flipper / p_mass_yr + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Saving plots\nIf you hadn‚Äôt already, now that you‚Äôve learned to create publication-ready multi-panel figures, you are probably wondering how you can save these plots.\nPerhaps you‚Äôve seen the ‚ÄúExport‚Äù button in the plotting pane, which can can do this. However, a better and more flexible way is to use the ggsave() function. By default, it will save the last plot you produced to the specified file:\n\nggsave(\"test_plot.png\")\n\nIf you do need to specify the plot object explicitly, you can pass it as the second argument:\n\nggsave(\"test_plot2.png\", p_bill_flipper)\n\nSome notes:\n\nYou can specify the file/image type (PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF, etc.) simply by providing the appropriate file extension.\nUse the height and width arguments to specify both the aspect ratio and the absolute size. Larger sizes will lead to relatively smaller text and points, which can be a convenient way to customize this!\nFor raster graphic formats like PNG, you can specify the resolution with the dpi argument.\n\n\n Exercise 6\nSave one or more of your previously produced plots as PNG images, and vary:\n\nThe aspect ratio and asbolute size with height and width\nThe resolution with dpi"

Your research is reproducible when third parties are able to perform the same analysis on your data, and produce the same results.\nReproducibility is perhaps a low bar compared to the related concept of replicability, which is the ability to produce the same (qualitative) results when applying the same analysis to different data. Here is a helpful table showing these two and two other related concepts:\n\n\n\nFrom The Turing Way\n\n\nFor example:\n\nSay that you‚Äôve written a paper in which you present the results of one of your research projects. When this research is fully reproducible, it means that someone else should be able to be able to run the exact same analysis and produce all the results and figures using your paper and its associated documentation.\nRelatedly, when you work in a reproducible manner and you abandon an analysis for say two years, you will be able to pick up from where you left off without much trouble.\n\n\n\nUsing R is already a big step in the right direction!\n\n‚ÄúThe most basic principle for reproducible research is: Do everything via code.‚Äù ‚ÄîKarl Broman, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nIt is inherently more reproducible to write code, such as in R, as opposed to clicking around in a program with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).\nIn addition, R is open source and freely available. If you use a proprietary program that requires an expensive license, your work may be reproducible in principle, but won‚Äôt be in practice for many people.\n\n\n\nAdditional aspects & the plan for this series\nResearch that is fully reproducible should use a set of tools and best-practice related to:\n\nFile organization\nFile version management\nProject documentation\nCode style and organization\nData and code sharing\nSoftware management\n\nThis series of Code Club sessions will not extensively cover the above, but we will cover three topics that touch on all of them:\n\nFile organization and ‚ÄúRStudio Projects‚Äù (today)\nCombining code and text (‚Äúliterate programming‚Äù) with Quarto (sessions 2 and 3)\nFile version control and code sharing with Git and GitHub (sessions 4 and 5)\nUsing RStudio at OSC (session 6, part I)\nR version & package management (session 6, part II)"

When you open R (or Python, or a Terminal, etc.), it will always have a starting point at a specific location in your computer1.\nThere are functions to change your working dir as well as ways to refer to any location on the computer regardless of whether you are there. That brings us to the third term, path, which is a specification of the location of a file or folder on the computer.\nThe key concept here is that folders are separated by slashes ‚Äì forward slashes in Mac and Linux, for example:\n/Users/John Doe/Desktop/cats.png\n‚Ä¶and backward slashes in Windows, for example:\nC:\\Users\\John Doe\\Desktop\\cats.png\nThere are two types of paths:\n\nAbsolute paths start from a root (top-level) directory, and correctly point to a file or folder regardless of what your working dir is. If you think of a path as a way to point to a geographic location, then absolute paths are like GPS coordinates. The two paths above are examples of absolute (or ‚Äúfull‚Äù) paths.\nRelative paths start from a specific working dir (and won‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre elsewhere). If you think of a path as a way to point to a geographic location, then relative paths are like directions like ‚ÄúTake the second left‚Äù. For example:\n\nresults/fastqc/sampleA.html\n\n\n\nCould a file name by itself, like myscript.R, be considered a path? If so, what kind, and what is the implied location of the file?\n\nA file name that does not include a folder, like myscript.R, can indeed be considered a path: a relative path that assumes the file is in your current working directory.\n\n\n\nDon‚Äôt absolute paths sound better? What could be a disadvantage of them?\n\nAbsolute paths:\n\nDon‚Äôt generally work across computers\nBreak when your move a project folder hierarchy to a a different place on your computer\n\nOn the other hand, relative paths that use the root of the project folder hierarchy as the working dir, also work when moving the folder within and between computers.\n\n\n\n\nTwo project dir hierarchies, and the absolute and relative path to a (FASTQ) file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow everything was moved into Dropbox.The absolute path has changed, but the relative path remains the same."

Otherwise, you can follow along with my example, which will be a page about research projects on a personal website.\nEach page on your website has a corresponding .qmd source document. Currently, we just have two pages:\n\nA home page, for which index.qmd is the source.\nAn ‚Äúabout page‚Äù, for which about.qmd is the source.\n\nSo, to create a new page, we will create a new Quarto document ‚Äî in RStudio, click File =&gt; New File =&gt; Quarto Document:\n\n\n\nThe window to create a new Quarto document\n\n\nUnlike last week, make sure the ‚ÄúUse visual markdown editor‚Äù box is checked, and then click the ‚ÄúCreate Empty Document‚Äù button in the bottom left.\nOnce the file has been created, let‚Äôs save it straight away: press Ctrl/Cmd+S. Save it in the top-level folder for your website, i.e.¬†the same folder that contains index.qmd and about.qmd. If you‚Äôre making a page for which you have your own ideas, you can name it accordingly ‚Äî otherwise, save it as research.qmd.\n\n\n\nYour near-empty document should look something like this\n\n\nThe newly created document will only contain a few lines, as shown in the screenshot above.

Let‚Äôs dive a little deeper into YAML, because it‚Äôs one of the key components of your website‚Äôs source."

    "section": "2 A little more about YAML",
    "text": "2 A little more about YAML\nYAML (‚ÄúYAML Ain‚Äôt Markup Language‚Äù, a silly joke of a name) is a simple format commonly used for configuration. In the source files for your website, there is a lot of YAML content straight away.\nFirst, you have the _quarto.yml file that configures your website, including its navigation elements that are visible on every page of the site, like the ‚Äúnavbar‚Äù at the top. But there is also YAML in the headers of all .qmd files. For example, the top of our newly created research.qmd should read:\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\n---\nAs opposed to the _quarto.yml file, this YAML header:\n\nIs surrounded by lines that only contain three dashes ---, that mark the beginning and the end of this YAML header.\nConfigures just this individual page, whereas the YAML in _quarto.yml specifies site-wide configurations.\n\n\nYAML consists of entries of key-value pairs: in the example above, title is the key that determines what the document‚Äôs title will be, and \"Untitled\" is the current value.\nValid YAML keys are limited to what has been pre-defined by others (i.e., in this case, the developers of Quarto), and the list of possible keys depends on the document type. The Quarto website has a full list of valid YAML keys for the _quarto.yml file as well as a a list for HTML pages, which is the kind of output that your .qmd files will produce when rendered.\nDepending on the key, the value can be:\n\nA ‚Äúfree-form string‚Äù of text, like for a title\nConstrained to a series of possible values, like for the theme key, which can set the overall look of a page to one of a few dozen available ‚Äúthemes‚Äù\nAn on/off switch using true/false, like whether to show a Table of Contents using the toc key.\n\n\n\n2.1 YAML‚Äôs structure\nYAML‚Äôs structure is quite simple, but it does have a few rules. Each entry is generally on its own line. It has a hierarchical structure in that many values can itself be given key-value pairs to specify additional options. For example, see this section from your _quarto.yml file:\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\nNote how the values for keys that simply take a value (above: theme, css, and toc) and have no ‚Äúchild keys‚Äù are on the same line as the key.\nIn contrast, keys whose values are really ‚Äúchild keys‚Äù (above: format and html):\n\nAre followed by a colon :\nAre on a line by themselves\nHave their child keys on the next line(s), indented one more level.\n\nIndentation in YAML has to use either two or four spaces (no tabs!) per indentation level, and YAML is sensitive to indentation errors. (Note that RStudio will by default insert multiple spaces instead of a true tab when you press the Tab key, so you can still use that just fine.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-wide vs.¬†page-specific configuration\n\n\n\nThis format =&gt; html section in the _quarto.yml file will set defaults for the formatting of individual pages on your website. You can use the same keys (e.g.¬†theme, css, and toc shown above) in the YAML header of your qmd files, which would override these site-wide settings.\n\n\n\nA final component of YAML syntax, with lists of entries, is used in the website section of _quarto.yml:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Lucy's adventures in science\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\nHere, each entry (= each page on your website) is preceded by a dash -, and:\n\nThe top entry, for the homepage, has an href key pointing to the relevant file, as well as a text key (note: same indentation level, no additional dash) that will set what text is being displayed for this link.\nThe bottom entry uses an alternative specification method, with just a pointer to the file. When you do this, the displayed test on the website would be the same as the file name without the .qmd extension, namely ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML errors (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you made a mistake in the YAML, you will see an ominous-looking box like this pop up:\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll see this error if you specified an invalid key in your YAML. Don‚Äôt panic! If you don‚Äôt already know what‚Äôs wrong, carefully read the error which is quite informative."

Here, we can use the same YAML keys that we could use in the YAML header of our new page (and any other page), except that the settings will be applied across all pages on the site.\n\n\n\n5.1 The website section\nIn my example, this section currently reads as follows ‚Äì yours should be the same except for the title unless you did some customization yourself already:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Lucy's adventures in science\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\nThe navbar key represents a navigation bar that is always shown across the top of the site, which should be a good default for most websites. But if you want a website navigation bar on the side, or combined top and side navigation (the latter is useful for sites with a lot of contents, and is used for example on Quarto‚Äôs own documentation website), this is possible: see Quarto‚Äôs Website Navigation docs.\nAny entries under the left key will be left-aligned on the navbar, i.e.¬†consecutive entries start on the left-hand side of the navbar, moving rightward with every added entry. We could also add right-aligned entries with a right key (see the exercise below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavbar auto-collapse (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the width of your viewing window is narrow (like it often is in RStudio‚Äôs ‚ÄúViewer‚Äù, as well as on phones), the navbar will be automatically collapsed into a ‚ÄúHamburger menu:‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want our new page to show up in the navbar, we‚Äôll have to add it as a new entry:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Lucy's adventures in science\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n      - href: research.qmd\n        text: My Research\n\nSome other useful keys for the website section include (see this Quarto docs page for a full list):\n\nback-to-top-navigation (a child key of website): When set to true, this will show a ‚ÄúBack to top‚Äù button once you reach the bottom of a page.\nfavicon (a child key of website): A favicon is an icon or small image that shows up in your browser next to the name of the website, see the icons shown in screenshot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicon (a navbar entry like href and text): This will allow you to show an icon instead of (default for external links) or in addition to text (default for internal links) for a link in your navbar. See here for a list of available icons. For example:\n\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n        icon: house\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 The html format section\nHere is what the format section of your _quarto.yaml should look like:\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\nAs mentioned before, the configuration done in this section can use the same keys as those in the YAML header for individual pages, but the settings done in _quarto.yaml will apply across the entire website.\nFor now, we‚Äôll only talk about one key: theme. This will change the overall look of your website to a number of preset themes, each with different fonts and colors. While you can also completely customize your website‚Äôs look yourself, using one of these themes should work well for most of us.\nYou can see a visual list of available themes at https://bootswatch.com/. The default theme is cosmo, as you can see above. As an example, if we change Lucie‚Äôs website theme to lux:"

    "text": "2 A little more basic interaction with R\n\n2.1 The R prompt, revisited\nThe &gt; sign in your console is the R ‚Äúprompt‚Äù. It indicates that R is ready for you to type something.\nWhen you are not seeing the &gt; prompt, R is either busy (because you asked it to do a longer-running computation) or waiting for you to complete an incomplete command.\nType the following into your console, and press Enter (called Return on a Mac, but you get the idea):\n\n203 /\n\nYou should notice that your prompt turned into a +.\n\n\nWhat is going on here? (Click for the answer)\n\nR is waiting for you to finish the command, since you typed an incomplete command: something has to follow the division sign /.\n\nTo get out of this situation, one option is to try and finish the command (in this case, by typing another number) ‚Äî but here, let‚Äôs practice another option: aborting the command by pressing Esc.\nWhile it was obvious here that our command was incomplete, you will often type incomplete commands without realizing you did so (typical cases include forgetting a closing parenthesis )). Aborting and fixing the command in full is often the way to go, especially if you‚Äôre writing code in a script (as we‚Äôll do below).\n\n\n\n2.2 R data types\nIf we just type a number and press Enter‚Ä¶\n\n203\n\n[1] 203\n\n\n‚Ä¶ then R will simply print the number back to us.\nUnder the hood, R is calling a function called print()1, and we saw an example of this last week, too ‚Äî typing the name of an object will print it‚Äôs value:\n\nx &lt;- 5\nx\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nRather than a number, what if we want R to print back to us some text, which in programming lingo is called a ‚Äúcharacter string‚Äù?\n\nFantastic\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Fantastic' not found\n\n\n\n\nWhat seems to be going wrong? (Click for the answer)\n\nWhenever you type a character string, R expects to find an object with that name (we saw our first object x last week, and will talk more about them today).\nWhen no object exists with that name, R will throw an error.\n\nWe can get R to print character strings back to us, and use them in other ways, as long as they are quoted:\n\n\"Fantastic\"\n\n[1] \"Fantastic\"\n\n\"Code Club\"\n\n[1] \"Code Club\"\n\n\nSo, R treats numbers and character strings differently: unlike numbers, character strings need to be quoted. This avoids confusion with objects because unquoted character strings are assumed to be objects, and also allows for ‚Äúspecial characters‚Äù like spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote types\n\n\n\nDouble quotes (\"Fantastic\") and single quotes ('Fantastic') can be used interchangeably in R. Double quotes are preferred by most ‚Äústyle guides‚Äù.\n\n\nA little more on R‚Äôs main ‚Äúdata types‚Äù:\n\nNumbers are by default of the data type numeric (and can also be integer - whole numbers only)\nCharacter strings are by default of the data type character (and can also be factor for categorical data)\nThe final main data type is logical, which can be either TRUE or FALSE."

Here, we wanted to assign the literal string \"introduction\" to the object session_topic ‚Äî so the former should be quoted and the latter not.\nAn error is produced when you run the second option, because the object introduction does not exist (unless, of course, you had created an object of that name!):\n\nsession_topic &lt;- introduction\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'introduction' not found\n\n\n\nB) Having run the code above, which of the following would make R print \"introduction\"?\n\n\"session_topic\"\n\n\nsession_topic\n\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\nThe second option is the correct one: here, we want to have R print the value of the object session_topic (which we had just created in exercise A), so we shouldn‚Äôt use quotes.\n\nsession_topic\n\n[1] \"introduction\"\n\n\n\nC) Do you think the following code would successfully add 5 and 7? If not, what might happen instead?\n\n\"5\" + \"7\"\n\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\nIn the code above, the ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù are saved not as numbers (in R lingo: as a numeric) but as character strings (character).\nR can‚Äôt add character strings, so it will return an error:\n\n\"5\" + \"7\"\n\nError in \"5\" + \"7\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\n(Perhaps you expected it to combine/‚Äúconcatenate‚Äù the two strings in some way ‚Äî this is in fact what Python would do. Or to automatically convert the characters to numbers, since you‚Äôre clearly wanting them to be numbers ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt do that either.)\n\nD) (Bonus) Execute the following code and check its output:\n\nTRUE + FALSE\n\nHad you expected this result? If not, can you make sense of it: the fact that it works, the specific results, and the fact that we are not using quotes in the code.\nAnd based on your deliberations, what do you expect the following code to return?\n\nTRUE + TRUE\n\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\n\nLogicals (TRUE and FALSE) can be used as numbers, in which case TRUE is equivalent to 1, and FALSE is equivalent to 0.\nTherefore, TRUE + FALSE will return 1, and TRUE + TRUE will therefore return 2.\nLogicals (TRUE and FALSE) are made up of letters but are not character strings, so they shouldn‚Äôt be quoted."

    "text": "4 R scripts\n\n4.1 The editor pane\nJess showed us the four quadrants of RStudio last week:\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those contains a ‚ÄúSource Editor‚Äù pane, as in a Text Editor. Here, we can open and edit all sorts of text files ‚Äî including R scripts. This quadrant will disappear if you have no files open:\n\nCreate and open a new R script by clicking File (top menu bar) &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Why use a script?\nAn R script is a text file that contains R code.\nSo far, we have been typing commands directly into the R console. But it‚Äôs a good idea to write and save most of our code in scripts.\nThis helps us keep track of what we‚Äôve been doing, especially in the longer run, and to re-run our code after modifying input data or one of the lines of code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive scripts\n\n\n\nFor those of you who are familiar with the notion of a script from other contexts or programming languages ‚Äî saving our code as a script does not mean that we necessarily need to run the entire script all at once.\nIn R, it is instead most common to write and run code interactively, often line by line.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Saving the script\nLet‚Äôs save this new script right away‚Ä¶\n\nClick File &gt; Save As\n\n‚Ä¶ and give it a descriptive name like codeclub_02.R:\n\nYou may want to put the script in a folder for Code Club ‚Äî which should be automatically selected if you are using your Code Club RStudio Project.\nMake sure it has the file extension .R ‚Äî which should also have been automatically suggested by the pop-up window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile extensions\n\n\n\nAn R script is just a plain-text file and you could also save it with, for example, a .txt extension ‚Äî this will not break the file, but does have drawbacks.\nWhen you use a .R extension, your computer and RStudio alike will recognize it as an R script. In RStudio, this means you‚Äôll get some formatting that helps when writing your R code, and it can even recognize and warn you about certain errors in your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Sending code to the console\nIf you write most of your code in a script in the Editor, as we recommended above, wouldn‚Äôt it be a hassle to execute it? Do you need to copy-and-paste the code into the console? Luckily not.\nStart by by typing another simple calculation, this time in your R script:\n\n203 / 2.54\n\nWith the cursor still on this line of code in the script, press Ctrl + Enter (or, on a Mac: Cmd + Enter).\nThe code will be copied to the R console and executed (so you should see the result printed as shown below), and additionally, the cursor will move to the next line in the script.\n\n\n[1] 79.92126\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on sending code to the console\n\n\n\nNote that it doesn‚Äôt matter where on the line your cursor is: Ctrl + Enter will always execute the entire line unless you have selected only part of it. (And when you have selected multiple lines of code, it will execute them all.)\nTo execute a line of code, an alternative to the keyboard shortcut is to click the Run button in the bar right above your script, but we recommend using the keyboard shortcut ‚Äî it is much faster, at least once you get used to it.\n\n\nFor the rest of this Code Club session, try to write your code in your script, and send it to the console using the keyboard shortcut.\n\n\n\n4.5 Commenting\nYou can use # signs to comment your code:\n\n# Divide by 2.54 to get the wingspan in inches:\n203 / 2.54    # Original measurement was in cm\n\n\nAnything to the right of a # is ignored by R, meaning it won‚Äôt be executed\nYou can use # both at the start of a line (entire line is a comment) or anywhere in a line following code (rest of the line is a comment)\nIn your R script, comments are formatted differently so you can clearly distinguish them from code\n\nWe recommend that you use lots of comments in your R scripts! They are useful not only for others that you may share your code with, but also for yourself when you look back at your code a day, a month, or a year later."

    "title": "R Basics 2: Scripts and Objects",
    "section": "5 R Objects",
    "text": "5 R Objects\n\n5.1 Assigning stuff to R objects\nAs we‚Äôve seen a couple of times now, we can assign a value to an object with the assignment operator &lt;-. A few more examples:\n\nwingspan_cm &lt;- 203\nconversion &lt;- 2.54\n\nType that into your script, and use Ctrl/Cmd + Enter twice to send it to the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Environment tab\n\n\n\nRecall also that the objects you create get added to your ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù, which RStudio shows in the Environment tab in the top-right panel ‚Äî check that wingspan_cm and conversion are indeed there.\n\n\nAfter you‚Äôve assigned a number to an object, you can use it in calculations like so:\n\nwingspan_cm / conversion\n\n[1] 79.92126\n\n\nOr, similarly:\n\nwingspan_inch &lt;- wingspan_cm / conversion\nwingspan_inch\n\n[1] 79.92126\n\n\nThis illustrates that when you execute code with objects, R substitutes the object name that you provide by its contents under the hood. In other words, the object is just a reference to the underlying value(s).\n‚ÄúObject‚Äù is a general term that encompasses R items of any size or complexity:\n\nObjects can also contain character strings, collections of numbers or character strings (including in table or matrix format), and functions.\nThe above does not mean that ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù ‚Äî R distinguishes between a limited number of ‚Äúdata structures‚Äù, each with their own defined structure. We‚Äôll learn about the most important ones next week.\nThe objects we created so far are called vectors, which are more commonly thought of as containing a series of values, but in R, can have a length of one2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on assignment operators\n\n\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for the assignment operator is Alt/Option + -.\nNote that you can also use = as an assignment operator, as is common in other programming languages. But because = can have other meanings, we recommend sticking with the &lt;- combination.\n\n# This also works to assign the value 5 to x (but we recommend using &lt;- instead)\nx = 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Object names\nObjects can be given almost any name such as x, current_temperature, or subject_id. Some pointers on object names:\n\nBecause R is case sensitive, wingspan_inch is different from Wingspan_inch!\nAn object name cannot contain spaces ‚Äî so for readability, you should separate words using:\n\nUnderscores: wingspan_inch (this is called ‚Äúsnake case‚Äù, which we often use in Code Club)\nPeriods: wingspan.inch\nCapitalization: wingspanInch or WingspanInch (‚Äúcamel case‚Äù)\n\nYou will make things easier for yourself by naming objects in a consistent way, for instance by always sticking to your favorite case style like ‚Äúsnake case.‚Äù3\nObject names can contain but cannot start with a number: x2 is valid but 2x is not. (There are also some other restrictions that are beyond the scope of this introduction4.)\nMake object names descriptive yet not too long ‚Äî this is not always easy!\n\n\n\nThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.\n‚Äì Phil Karlton\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Saving the environment\nRecall that your environment contains all the R objects that you created. When you close R, it will probably ask you whether you want to save your environment (AKA workspace) ‚Äî something like:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you do save this, the next time you start R, R will reload your environment so you can pick up right where you left off. While this may seem convenient, we recommend that you don‚Äôt do this.\n\n\nCan you think of a reason why automatically saving and reloading your workspace may not be a good idea? (Click for the answer)\n\nThe main reason why this is generally not considered good practice relates to the idea that you should be able to reproduce your environment (and more broadly speaking, your analysis) from the code in your script.\nRemember that you can modify your environment either by entering commands in the console directly, or by running them from a script ‚Äî or even from multiple different scripts. Additionally, it is common to run lines in a script out of order, or write lines in the script that you don‚Äôt execute.\nTherefore, if you ‚Äúcarry around‚Äù the same environment across multiple different sessions, you run a greater risk of not having a reproducible set of steps in your script.\n\nGenerally, a better way of working in R than saving your entire environment is to use and save scripts (as we‚Äôve seen today) and to save specific outputs such as tables and plots (as we‚Äôll see soon).\nTo make RStudio stop asking you about saving your workspace, click Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; General and (un)check the boxes as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestarting R\n\n\n\nTaking the ideas about reproducibility a step further, it can be a good idea to occasionally restart R in the middle of working on some code.\nThat way, you can check whether the code in your script is correct and complete, that you are not relying on code that is not in the script, and so on.\nTo do so, you don‚Äôt need to close and reopen RStudio itself: under Session in the top menu bar, you can click Restart R (and you should also see the keyboard shortcut for it in the menu bar: Ctrl + Shift + F10 (Windows) / Cmd + Shift + 0 (Mac)."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe are going to begin this semester‚Äôs Code Club with a series on making yourself a website. There are lots of reasons why you might want a website, including to:\n\nhave a web presence about yourself (so when people google you, they can find your relevant info)\nhave a blog where you post about whatever it is you want to post about\nshare your research or data\n\nSome of you may already have a simple free or paid website for yourself, that you made through www.u.osu.edu, Squarespace, or Google Sites. These tools don‚Äôt require you to be able to code, and allow you to create a website with different levels of customization and interactivity.\nFor the next few sessions, we are going to go over making a website using Quarto. Quarto can be used as an open-source publishing system and you can integrate content from Jupyter notebooks, plain text markdown, Python, R, Julia and others. We are going to use Quarto integrated with R.\n\nTake a look at a gallery of Quarto website examples.\n\nWe picked this particular platform to go over in Code Club since its lightweight, customizable, free, and integrates with R which you‚Äôre probably learning anyway. I am going to start going through an example that will be my personal website. I picked this example because I thought this might be of interest to most of you."

You can do so by typing (or copying) the following into your R Console inside RStudio:\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n\nWhile not necessary for basic website building inside RStudio, it will also be a good idea to have Quarto installed moving forward. This is not an R package, but is a separate piece of software. To install it, go to https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ and the correct installer for your operating system should be highlighted in a blue box. Click on that box to download and once downloaded, click on the installer to install Quarto.\n\n\n\nThe blue box should highlight the installer for your operating system."

When asked which Project Type you want, pick Quarto Website. Note that you can also initiate a Quarto Blog which is a type of Quarto Website - since the website template is simpler we are going to start there, and can change back in the future if you want. If you want to read ahead, here is a nice website about making your Quarto website into a blog.\n\n\n\na screen shot of the new project wizard - we are picking Quarto Website, or the third from the bottom choice\n\n\nYou will then be asked where you want this website to live in your computer. Under Directory Name pick the name of the folder you want your content to be in, and Create project as subdirectory of as where you want the location on your computer. I have used the Knitr engine for website building.\n\n\n\na screen shot of the new project wizard where we indicate our directory name and where that directory will reside. we use knitr engine to run, and are not creating a git repo, using renv, or using visual markdown editor. we are opening in a new session\n\n\nI am not creating a git repository (since we haven‚Äôt gone over that yet, we will add it later after we finish our site), am not using renv with this project (which automatically saves your environment), and I am not default using the visual editor (which let‚Äôs you look at your markdown files how they will look when executed) since I want you to get used to looking at markdown. You can always toggle the visual editor later.\nOnce you do this basically you have all the bones of a website! Congratulations ü•≥"

We also have a search bar that allows us to search on our site.\nNow that we know what information we see on our site, we can look at the files that are used to build the site and try and interpret them.\n\n\n\na screenshot of the files generated by creating our skeleton website in the bottom right quadrant\n\n\nBefore we open the files, let‚Äôs talk about the file extensions and what they mean:\n\n.yml is a YAML or the file that indicates how the website will be configured\n.qmd is a Quarto markdown document, and if you‚Äôre familiar with RMarkdown .Rmd documents its very similar. It contains both text written in markdown and executable code.\n.css is a Cascading Style Sheets file that indicates the way to style an HTML document (i.e., your website)\n.Rproj is a R Project file that designates your working directory\n\nWe also have a folder _site which houses the knitted website files. More about this later."

    "text": "Artwork from ‚ÄúHello, Quarto‚Äù keynote by Julia Lowndes and Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel, presented at RStudio Conference 2022. Illustrated by Allison Horst.‚Äù\n\n1 Introduction\nToday we are going to continue customizing our website by:\n\nMaking a fancy about page\nLearning how to make multi-level drop down menu headers\nChanging our website themeing in _quarto.yml\nDoing some light (S)CSS styling to change the visuals of our site\n\nThen, we will push our changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. But first:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there other things you want to learn how to do with your website?\n\n\nPlease share!\n\n\n\n\nA good way to see what is possible to do with your website is to browse through some other people‚Äôs sites. There is a Quarto website gallery here. Just like people can access the source code on your website, you can often do the same for others. This means if you see a feature you like, you can go into their website code and try and figure out how its done.\n\n\n2 Updating our About page\nBecause many people who have a Quarto website will have an About page, there are some special, nicely formatted templates which you can use. You can learn more about fancy about pages here, inclduing seeing what the different templates look like.\nWe are going to practie with our Code Club practice-website.\nFirst, let‚Äôs set one of the about templates in the YAML of our about.qmd file. I am going to start with jolla.\ntitle: \"About me\"\nabout:\n  template: jolla\n  image: name_of_image.jpg\nBefore we render this page, we need to make sure the image we want to appear in this about page is in the home directory of your website. If you want to keep all your images in a subfolder so they‚Äôre not just floating around loose, you can. And then your YAML will look like this:\ntitle: \"About me\"\nabout:\n  template: jolla # could also use trestles, solana, marquee, broadside\n  image: img/name_of_image.jpg\nIf you want to use some of the other templates, like trestles, solana, marquee, and broadside, you will want to have other information in your about.qmd, perhaps sections on Education and Experience.\nCheck out using these different templates and pick the one you like the most if you want to customize your about page.\n\n\n3 Creating multi-level drop down menu headers\nEarlier I mentioned we can go into other websites to see how different features are coded. We are going to do this on the OSU Code Club website to see how it has achieved having multi-level headers. We can also visit the source repository on GitHub to see how this website is formatted.\nIf you look at the Code Club website homepage, you can see that the header ‚ÄúNew here?‚Äù has a drop down, and allows you to choose from a few different options.\n\nHow was that done? If you remember back a few sessions ago, we set what our headers were going to be in the _quarto.yml file. Let‚Äôs see what that file looks like from the Code Club source repo.\nThe _quarto.yml looks like this:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  preview: \n    navigate: false\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"OSU Code Club\"\n  site-url: https://osu-codeclub.github.io/\n  repo-url: https://github.com/osu-codeclub/osu-codeclub.github.io\n  repo-actions: [edit, issue]\n  page-navigation: true\n  back-to-top-navigation: true\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: pages/schedule.qmd\n        text: Schedule\n      - href: pages/previous.qmd\n        text: Previous sessions\n      - text: New here?\n        menu:\n        - text: Computer setup for Code Club\n          href: pages/setup.qmd\n        - text: R resources for beginners\n          href: pages/r_resources.qmd\n        - text: Sign up!\n          href: https://forms.gle/eYkMvmJShrcANUrt5\nLooking at this we can see what code is used for make drop down headers. You can copy this code into your _quarto.yml and then modify the text and href to be appropriate for your site.\nRemember that when you link to new pages, you will need to have material for that page to populate. If we look at the example above, the ‚ÄúComputer setup for Code Club‚Äù material is in a file called setup.qmd in a folder called pages in the home directory of the website.\n\n\n4 Altering website styling in _quarto.yml\nMaking simpler changes, like setting your background colors and fonts, you can do by altering your _quarto.yml file under the format header. For example, we could make the following changes to our practice-website.\nwebsite:\n  navbar:\n    background: \"#06280C\" # foresty green\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: flatly\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n    mainfont: Proxima Nova\n    backgroundcolor: \"#CFDAD3\" # light grey\n    monobackgroundcolor: \"#CFDAD3\" # light grey\n    title-block-banner: \"#06280C\" # foresty green\n    title-block-banner-color: \"#CFDAD3\" # light grey\n    fontcolor: \"#06280C\" # foresty green\n    linkcolor: \"#0E11E2\" # hyperlink blue\nYou don‚Äôt need to comment on what your colors are, I just like to do this since I have no connection between hexadecimal codes and actual colors, and this helps me to remember what is what. You can see all of the html options you can change within your YAML here\nOnce you made changes, render your website to see what they look like.\n\n\n5 Altering (S)CSS code to change website styling\nSometimes you might want to make more changes that what you can do using the avaiable keys in your YAML. When that is the case, you can make additional alterations by creating a .scss theme file.\nCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to format the layout of a webpage. By learning how to modify existing CSS files, it is relatively simple to change how your website looks. SCSS is Sassy CSS and the difference is not really important right now, but I think the .scss files are a little easier to modify, and are the default in Quarto, so we are going to work from those.\nThe Quarto website built in themes use Bootswatch and both the Code Club and practice-website use flatly so let‚Äôs start there. You can find .scss. files for each theme in the Quarto GitHub source repo here. I am going to go to the flatly theme and download it using the ‚ÄúDownload raw file‚Äù button in the top right of the page. Save this file in the home directory of your website.\n\nLet‚Äôs open it in RStudio. We will play around with making some changes.\nOne thing you might want to change first are the colors. Quarto accepts color information as hexadecimal codes. If you want to know the hexadecimal 6 digit code for any color you can go to www.htmlcolorcodes.com to find the color/code pair that you want.\nIn the Quarto documentation, you can find information about the Sass variables that can be specified within your .scss. file what what they mean.\n\n\n6 Commit and push to GitHub\nOnce you are happy with your changes, the last step is to commit and push them to GitHub so the changes can be reflected on your website. You can do this in GitHub desktop by entering a comment in the bottom left, committing to main (or master), and then push to origin.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

R is a programming language while RStudio has a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to more easily use R. RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), meaning its a separate program that has an interface designed for running R. You can run R just using the R console (i.e., standalone R) but it is really easier and you will find additional functionality if you use RStudio. We need to download both R and RStudio.\n\n3.1 Downloading/installing R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using an Ohio State computer where you don‚Äôt have administrative access, R and RStudio are available to download through the Software Center (Windows) and Self Service (Mac).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will download R first. At the time of me writing this (January 2024) the most updated version of R is R-4.3.2.\n\nYou can download R for Windows, Mac, or UNIX. https://www.r-project.org/\nPick your preferred CRAN mirror, I like to use the one from Case Western Reserve University since it‚Äôs the closest to us in Ohio I think it‚Äôs probably the fastest, though any mirror will work.\nDownload R for Linux, Windows, or Mac, depending on what type of operating system you are running. You can use these direct links to download 4.3.2.\n\nWindows\nM1/M2 Mac, requires Xquartz\nOlder Macs, requires Xquartz\n\n\nNavigate to where you‚Äôve downloaded your executable R file, and install it.\nYou can also use R and RStudio through the Ohio Supercomputing Center. If you want to do this, connect with Jelmer and he can add you to our Code Club project.\nAs of January 2024, the most recent version of R is 4.3.2. If you already have R and it is version &gt;4.2, no need to do anything.\n\nIf you‚Äôve already installed R and just need to update, and want to make sure you keep all your downloaded packages, follow these instructions. Updating only RStudio doesn‚Äôt do anything to your packages.\n\n\n\n3.2 Downloading/installing RStudio\nOnce you have R, you can download RStudio. Here you can download the version of RStudio\nNavigate to where you‚Äôve downloaded your executable RStudio file, and install it.\nOnce you‚Äôve downloaded both R and RStudio, you can open RStudio."

Directories are hierarchical, and slightly different on different operating systems (e.g., Mac, Windows, Linux). If you open up your Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows), you can navigate around the different locations on your computer.\nYour working directory is just as it sounds - it‚Äôs the location/path on your computer where you are currently working. This is important as your files will be by default read in, stored, and saved to this location. This means you need to know where this is.\n\n\n5.2 Find your working directory\nWe can figure out where our working directory is by typing into the console the function:\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/poelstra.1/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/mcic/teach/codeclub/codeclub-site/posts/S07E01_basics_01\"\n\n\nYou can see that the output path is MY working directory - yours will be different as the set up of your computer organization structure is different from mine. I am also using a Mac so you can see my path as forward slashes / while Windows machines will have backslashes\\.\nYou can also use the RStudio GUI to navigate to your working directory by going to the Files quadrant (bottom right), click the gear, and select Go To Working Directory.\n\n\n\nGo to your working directory by clicking\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Set your working directory\nIf your working directory is not where you want to store your files for code club, you can change it. We can do that using the function setwd().\n\nsetwd(\"/this/should/be/your/working-directory/path\")\n\nAlternatively, you can set your working directory by navigating in the Files (bottom right) quadrant to the location you want your working directory to be, then clicking the gear, and clicking Set As Working Directory.\n\n\n\nSet your working directory by clicking\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Avoid all working directory nonsense with a .RProj\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst\n\n\nUsing an Rproject (.RProj) will help you with working directory management. An Rproject allows you to keep all of the files associated with a particular project together - from input data, output data, code, resulting figures etc. What it does is set the location of the working directory to be the same place as where your Rproject is located.\nWe will make a new Rproject for all your code club files. You can create a project by navigating to File &gt; New Project. You can put your file in a New Directory (i.e., make a new folder where your code club files will live), or you can indicate an Existing Directory (i.e., the folder you already have where your code club files are located). I‚Äôm going to assume you don‚Äôt have already a code club folder, so we will pick: New Directory &gt; New Project. You can navigate to where you want the directory to be on your computer (best to put it somewhere static and not in your downloads or on your desktop), and give it a meaningful name, like code-club.\nNow, as long as I have the code-club Rproject open in RStudio, R knows to set the working directory to be the location you picked. This means if you want to load data, you should put it in that same folder, and when you write out results, they will also be by default in that same place."

    "text": "7 Using R like a calculator\nNow that we are a bit oriented to RStudio, we can begin actually using it. We aren‚Äôt going to be using any scripts today, simply working in the console (bottom left quadrant).\nIn the bottom left part of the console you should see a greater than sign (&gt;). This is where you will start typing. If you don‚Äôt see this &gt; it means your console is not ready to receive commands. You can press Esc once or a couple times to get back to your &gt;.\nLet‚Äôs start by typing the following code into your console:\n\n2 + 5\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nWhen we ask R to calculate this sum we get the answer, 7. Note that this number is simply printed into our console. You‚Äôll also note that there is also a [1] next to the answer of 7 since R is telling us that 7 is the first value in our vector. More about this another time.\nWhat if now, instead of asking R to calculate what 2 + 5 is and print the result we want to save this output as a variable stored within R? We can do that by assigning it to a variable. Here, I am going to assign the output to x and do this using the assignment operator &lt;- which looks like an arrow pointing to the left.\n\nx &lt;- 2 + 5\n\nYou will see when you do this in your console, you no longer see the answer 7. You only see the code you typed in, and your &gt; indicating R is ready for more.\nThis is because we have asked R to store this output as the variable x and we have not asked R to show us what x is. We can do that by simply typing:\n\nx\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nNow we see the answer 7.\nWe can also now see that the variable x is stored in our Environment (top right quadrant). This is where all of the objects that are active in your environment will live.\n\n\n\nA screenshot of our Environment tab (top right quadrant) now that we have assigned the sum of 2 and 5 to x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a R shorthand to both assign an object and print it at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you surround your code that is doing some assigning with parentheses, you will both assign the object and print it at the same time. Here‚Äôs an example:\n\n(j &lt;- 8 - 5)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we ask R for something that is not in our environment, like y we will get an error.\n\ny\n\n\nBut, now that we have x in our environment, we can use it to create new objects. If we wanted to create a new object y that was the result of x * 3, we could simply do:\n\ny &lt;- x * 3\n\nAnd if we want to see the answer, we type y.\n\ny\n\n[1] 21\n\n\n\nRemember that R uses classic mathematical order of operations, so do mind your parentheses."

    "text": "3 Exploring data with the count() function\nTo orient yourself a bit more to this dataset, you may want to see, for example, how many species and how many islands are in it, and how frequently each occur.\nIn other words, we may want to produce a few ‚Äúcount tables‚Äù, which is a common part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We can do this with the dplyr function count():\n\npenguins |&gt; count(species)\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 2\n  species       n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie      152\n2 Chinstrap    68\n3 Gentoo      124\n\n\n\npenguins |&gt; count(island)\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 2\n  island        n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Biscoe      168\n2 Dream       124\n3 Torgersen    52\n\n\nOK, so we have penguins that belong to 3 different species occur on 3 different islands. Which species occur on which islands? We can answer this with count() simply by specifying both columns:\n\npenguins |&gt; count(species, island)\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 3\n  species   island        n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie    Biscoe       44\n2 Adelie    Dream        56\n3 Adelie    Torgersen    52\n4 Chinstrap Dream        68\n5 Gentoo    Biscoe      124\n\n\n\n\nWhy are not all possible combinations of species and island shown here?\n\nSome species do not appear to occur on (or at least haven‚Äôt been sampled on) certain islands. These zero-counts are not show, or ‚Äúdropped, by default.\n\n\nTo show zero-count combinations, add .drop = FALSE:\n\npenguins |&gt; count(species, island, .drop = FALSE)\n\n# A tibble: 9 √ó 3\n  species   island        n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie    Biscoe       44\n2 Adelie    Dream        56\n3 Adelie    Torgersen    52\n4 Chinstrap Biscoe        0\n5 Chinstrap Dream        68\n6 Chinstrap Torgersen     0\n7 Gentoo    Biscoe      124\n8 Gentoo    Dream         0\n9 Gentoo    Torgersen     0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Base R‚Äôs table() function (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the base R table() function, which is similar to count(). While its output format is unwieldy for follow-up analyses, you may prefer its formatting especially when wanting to glance at a 2-way count table to see patterns:\n\ntable(penguins$species, penguins$island)\n\n           \n            Biscoe Dream Torgersen\n  Adelie        44    56        52\n  Chinstrap      0    68         0\n  Gentoo       124     0         0\n\n\n\nAdditionally, as a dplyr function, count() only works with data frames. You may sometimes need to create a count table for a vector, and table() can do that:\n\nspecies_vector &lt;- penguins$species\ntable(species_vector)\n\nspecies_vector\n   Adelie Chinstrap    Gentoo \n      152        68       124"

    "section": "6 The summarize() function",
    "text": "6 The summarize() function\nThe summarize() function from the dplyr package can compute across-row data summaries. As a first example, here‚Äôs how you can compute the overall mean bill length with this function:\n\npenguins_noNA |&gt;\n  summarize(mean(bill_length_mm))\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 1\n  `mean(bill_length_mm)`\n                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                   43.9\n\n\n(Note that we are now using penguins_noNA, which you created in the exercise above, and we will continue to do so during the rest of the session.)\nAs you can see, this function has quite a different output from the dplyr functions we‚Äôd seen so far. All of those returned a manipulated version of our original dataframe, whereas summarize() returns a ‚Äúcompletely new‚Äù dataframe with a summary of the original data.\nNote that the default summary column above is quite unwieldy, so we‚Äôll typically want to provide a column name for it ourselves:\n\npenguins_noNA |&gt;\n  summarize(bill_len_mean = mean(bill_length_mm))\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 1\n  bill_len_mean\n          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          43.9\n\n\nAlso, summarizing across all rows at once with summarize(), like we just did, is much more verbose than the simple ‚Äúbase R‚Äù solution we saw earlier (mean(penguins_noNA$bill_length_mm)). Are we sure this function is useful?\n\n\nSummarizing by group\nThe real power of summarize() comes with its ability to easily compute group-wise summaries. For example, simply by adding .by = species, it will calculate the mean bill length separately for each species:\n\npenguins_noNA |&gt;\n  summarize(bill_len_mean = mean(bill_length_mm), .by = species)\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 2\n  species   bill_len_mean\n  &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie             38.8\n2 Gentoo             47.5\n3 Chinstrap          48.8\n\n\nNice! We can also compute multiple summarized variables ‚Äî and use summarizing functions other than mean():\n\npenguins_noNA |&gt;\n  summarize(bill_len_mean = mean(bill_length_mm),\n            bill_len_max = max(bill_length_mm),\n            bill_len_min = min(bill_length_mm),\n            .by = species)\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 4\n  species   bill_len_mean bill_len_max bill_len_min\n  &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie             38.8         46           32.1\n2 Gentoo             47.5         59.6         40.9\n3 Chinstrap          48.8         58           40.9\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding group counts\nA handy helper function related to the count() function we used above is n(), which will compute the number of rows for each group (i.e.¬†the group sizes, which can be good to know, for example so you don‚Äôt make unfounded conclusions based on really small sample sizes):\n\npenguins_noNA |&gt;\n  summarize(bill_depth_mean = mean(bill_depth_mm),\n            n_penguins = n(),\n            .by = species)\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 3\n  species   bill_depth_mean n_penguins\n  &lt;fct&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie               18.3        151\n2 Gentoo               15.0        123\n3 Chinstrap            18.4         68\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon summary statistic functions\nHere is an overview of the most commonly used functions to compute summaries:\n\nmean() & median()\nmin() & max()\nsum()\nsd(): standard deviation\nIQR(): interquartile range\nn(): counts the number of rows (observations)\nn_distinct(): counts the number of distinct (unique) values\n\n\nTwo final comments about summarize():\n\nYou can also ask summarize() to compute summaries by multiple columns, which will return separate summaries for each combination of the involved variables ‚Äî we‚Äôll see this in the exercises.\nThis may be obvious, but whatever column you are computing summaries by (using .by) should be a categorical variable. In our diamond examples, we‚Äôre only using columns that are factors, but ‚Äúregular‚Äù character columns will work just fine as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: group_by() (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ‚Äúclassic‚Äù way of using summarize() with multiple groups is by preceding it with a group_by() call ‚Äî e.g., the code below is equivalent to our last example above:\n\npenguins_noNA |&gt;\n  group_by(species) |&gt; \n  summarize(bill_depth_mean = mean(bill_depth_mm),\n            n_penguins = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 3\n  species   bill_depth_mean n_penguins\n  &lt;fct&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie               18.3        151\n2 Chinstrap            18.4         68\n3 Gentoo               15.0        123\n\n\n\nThe .by argument to summarize() (and other functions!) is a rather recent addition, but I prefer it over group_by():\n\nIt is simpler, a bit less typing, and makes the summarize() call self-contained\nWhen grouping by multiple columns, group_by() has some odd, unhelpful behavior where it keeps some of the groupings, such that you likely need an ungroup() call as well."

The four most commonly used data structures in R are vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames. In this session, we will only be working with vectors.\nThe fundamental data structure in R is vectors, which are 1-dimensional data structures that can only contain one type of data (e.g., all entries must have the same mode). To create a vector in R, the function c() (concatenate or combine) is used, as shown below.\nLet‚Äôs create a vector named ‚Äúmy_vector‚Äù with 5 entries.\n\nmy_vector &lt;- c(10, 30, 50, 20, 40)\nmy_vector\n\n[1] 10 30 50 20 40\n\n\nThe output generated on the previous code chunk displays the entries in your vector, with the 1 in squared brackets indicating the position of the entry to its right in the vector. In this case, 10 is the first entry of the vector.\nIf, for any reason, we only wish to extract the value 50 from this vector, we can utilize our knowledge of it being in the third position to do so.\n\nmy_vector[3]\n\n[1] 50\n\n\nSince a vector can only contain one data type, all its members need to be of the same type. If you attempt to combine data of different types into a vector, R will not provide a warning, but rather coerce it to the most flexible type. (The order of flexibility, from least to most, is: logical, integer, double, character).

    "text": "2 Data manipulation with (base) R\n\n2.1 Create a new dataset\n###\n\n\nPlease create a new data frame and name it df. This data frame should consist of three columns (Control, Trt1, and Trt2) with 50 observations each. The Control column should contain 50 data points that follow a normal distribution with a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 10. Likewise, the Trt1 column should have a mean of 37 and a standard deviation of 10, and the Trt2 column should have a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 10. Additionally, add five blocks (a, b, c, d, e), each repeating 10 times. Let‚Äôs use the function set.seed(1234) to work with the same values. (Click for the answer)\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Control = rnorm(50, 35, 10),\n                 Trt1 = rnorm(50, 37, 10),\n                 Trt2 = rnorm(50, 75, 10),\n                 Block = rep(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"), 10))\n\n\n\n\nData mostly come in two shapes ‚Äì ‚Äúlong‚Äù format and ‚Äúwide‚Äù format.\nWhat type of data do you think is df? (Click for the answer)\n\nOur data frame df is in wide format.\n\n\n\n2.2 Extract variables (columns)\nThere are multiple ways to extract/select variables/columns. Here are two methods that we have previously used:\n\ndf[, c(\"Control\", \"Trt2\")] # by name\n\ndf[, c(1, 2)]  # by column index\n\n\n\n2.3 Make new variables (columns)\nLet‚Äôs create two new variables from existing ones:\n\ndf$Trt1.log &lt;- log(df$Trt1)\ndf$Trt2.log &lt;- log(df$Trt2)\n\n\n\n2.4 Extract observations (rows)\nThere are multiple ways to extract/filter observations/rows. Here are two ways we can do this:\n\n# Using [,]\ndf[df$Trt1.log &lt; 3.5, ]\n\ndf[df$Trt2.log &gt; 4.2 & df$Block == \"a\", ]\n\n# Using subset\nsubset(df, df$Trt2.log &gt; 4.2 & df$Block == \"a\")\n\n\n\n2.5 Arrange observations (rows)\nSorting is an operation that we typically perform when manipulating our dataset.\n\n# ascending order of Block (alphabetic) followed by ascending order of Trt2.log\ndf[order(df$Block, df$Trt2.log) , ]\n\n# descending order of Block (alphabetic) followed by ascending order of Trt2.log\ndf[order(rev(df$Block), df$Trt2.log) , ]\n\n\n\n2.6 Summarize observations (rows)\nThere are numerous ways to accomplish this task, and we will discover additional methods as we progress to the tidyverse package.\n\n# Manually create a data.frame\ndata.frame(Trt1.mean = mean(df$Trt1),\n           Trt1.sd = sd(df$Trt1),\n           Trt2.mean = mean(df$Trt2),\n           Trt2.sd = sd(df$Trt2))\n\n\n\n2.7 Summarize rows within groups\nTypically, our goal is to summarize data according to specific variables. Below is how we can achieve this:\n\n# First operate in the data.frame by group\ndf_by &lt;- by(df, \n   INDICES = list(df$Block),\n   FUN = function(x){\n     data.frame(Block = unique(x$Block),\n                Control.mean = mean(x$Control),\n                Control.sd = sd(x$Control),\n                Trt1.mean = mean(x$Trt1),\n                Trt1.sd = sd(x$Trt1),\n                Trt2.mean = mean(x$Trt2),\n                Trt2.sd = sd(x$Trt2))\n   })\n\n# Then combine the results into a data.frame\ndo.call(rbind, df_by)\n\nAlternatively, we can use the aggregate() function:\n\ndf.by &lt;- do.call(data.frame, aggregate(cbind(Control, Trt1, Trt2) ~ Block, data = df, FUN = function(x) c(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x) ) ))\ndf.by\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at each treatment graphically (we will do more data viz soon!):\n\nbarplot(df.by$Control.mean, names.arg =  paste(df.by$Block)) \n\nbarplot(df.by$Trt1.mean, names.arg =  paste(df.by$Block))\n\nbarplot(df.by$Trt2.mean, names.arg =  paste(df.by$Block))\n\n\n\n2.8 Reshape our data frame\nWide to long format:\nIn data analysis, the need to reshape the data frequently arises in order to enhance manageability and usefulness. Reshaping the data entails converting it from one format, such as wide, to another, like long, or vice versa. Such transformations aid in facilitating data accessibility, simplifying analysis, and providing more information.\n\nl &lt;- reshape(df, \n             varying = c(\"Control\", \"Trt1\", \"Trt2\", \"Trt1.log\", \"Trt2.log\"), \n             v.names = \"Yield\", \n             timevar = \"Treatment\", \n             times = c(\"Control\", \"Trt1\", \"Trt2\", \"Trt1.log\", \"Trt2.log\"), \n             new.row.names = 1:1000, \n             direction = \"long\")\n\nl"

    "text": "4.1 Pivoting Longer\nOne common problem mentioned in R for data science and by Hadley Wickham is when you have column names that are actually variable values (when a single variable is spread across multiple columns)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidenote\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a set of columns with variable values for names is actually very common in metabomolics or genomics data, where column titles are metabolites, genes, taxa, etc.\n\n\n\nHere is a dataset with this issue - This data denotes the population of Afghanistan, Brazil, and China for the years 1999 and 2000\n\ntable4b\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 3\n  country         `1999`     `2000`\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan   19987071   20595360\n2 Brazil       172006362  174504898\n3 China       1272915272 1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat are the variables in the table4b data?\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\nThe variables are\n\ncountry\nyear\npopulation\n\n\n\n\nThis format of data is sometimes called wide data, where the row of column names (the very first row) actually contains variable values.\nIn this data it doesn‚Äôt look very wide, but imagine how much wider if data was taken every year up to or past this year. Wide data tends to get wide very quickly.\n\nFor an example of very wide data, look at the who dataset\n\ndata(who)\n who\n\n# A tibble: 7,240 √ó 60\n   country  iso2  iso3   year new_sp_m014 new_sp_m1524 new_sp_m2534 new_sp_m3544\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1980          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 2 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1981          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 3 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1982          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 4 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1983          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 5 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1984          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 6 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1985          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 7 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1986          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 8 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1987          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 9 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1988          NA           NA           NA           NA\n10 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1989          NA           NA           NA           NA\n# ‚Ñπ 7,230 more rows\n# ‚Ñπ 52 more variables: new_sp_m4554 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_m5564 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_m65 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f014 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f1524 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_f2534 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f3544 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f4554 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_f5564 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f65 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m014 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sn_m1524 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m2534 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m3544 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sn_m4554 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m5564 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m65 &lt;dbl&gt;, ‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nTo make this data tidy, we need to the the column names (the year variable) and turn it into its own column (called year), and take all of the population data and put that into a second variable column (called population)\nPreviously with the classroom data we did this manually, but there is a much better way to pivot from wide messy data, to longer tidy data with the function pivot_longer\nLets look at the help file for it\n\n?pivot_longer\n\nFrom this, we see that the pivot_longer function can take a lot of aruguments, but there are only a few important ones\n\ncols, in which we select the columns to pivot (i.e., the columns whos names contain a variable)\nnames_to, in which we create a new column for where our old column names are to be put into\nvalues_to, in which we create a second new column for the values to be put into\n\nHere‚Äôs what that looks like in our example\n\ntidy_table4b &lt;- table4b |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = `1999`:`2000`, \n               names_to = \"year\", \n               values_to = \"population\") \n\n# note here the numbers are in backticks. This is because R treats column names as characters, and calling a name as number data won't work here. \n\n# the new column names also need to be in quotes here\n\ntidy_table4b\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 3\n  country     year  population\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan 1999    19987071\n2 Afghanistan 2000    20595360\n3 Brazil      1999   172006362\n4 Brazil      2000   174504898\n5 China       1999  1272915272\n6 China       2000  1280428583\n\n\nusing pivot_longer we turned a 3x3 table where the column names stored variable values into a 6x3 table where each column contains a single variable, and each row a single observation - and presto, tidy data!\nOne other thing to note here is that we are not pivoting every column. In some datasets you may only have a few columns that you would like to be longer\n\n4.1.1 More examples and uses of pivot\nPivoting isn‚Äôt just for cleaning up! When combined with other functions, pivoting can also be a very useful way to manipulate data to make it easier to analyze\nLast week, we used the summary function to find the mean height, width and depth of diamonds in the diamonds dataset\n\ndata(diamonds)\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_x = mean(x),\n            mean_y = mean(y),\n            mean_z = mean(z))\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 3\n  mean_x mean_y mean_z\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   5.73   5.73   3.54\n\n\nFor this we had to create a new column for every dimensional mean, which a.) takes a while to type, especially if we wanted to find the mean of further values and b.) comes out to not be tidy data\nAnother way to find the means for these columns is to use the pivot_longer function to make another column which we can group the values by\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \npivot_longer(cols = c(x:z), \n             names_to = \"dimension\", \n             values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_value = mean(value),\n            .by = dimension)\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 2\n  dimension mean_value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 x               5.73\n2 y               5.73\n3 z               3.54\n\n# note in cols, I'm not specifying x, y, and z individually.

I thought the whole point was to avoid having columns of variable values‚Äù\npivot_wider is an especially useful function in many situations. Here are only a few:\n\npivot_wider is useful where we have the opposite problem as we saw when learning pivot_longer - when a multiple variables are stored in a single column (single observation is scattered across more than one row)\npivot_wider can be useful when we want to make calculations across columns\nNot every function in R accepts tidy data, sometimes we do need wide data! (e.g., anything that requires a matrix, PCA)\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Using pivot_wider()\nLets see how pivot_wider() is used\nThis is a dataset containing population data and the number of cases of some disease in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China for the years 1999 and 2000\n\ntable2\n\n# A tibble: 12 √ó 4\n   country      year type            count\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan  1999 cases             745\n 2 Afghanistan  1999 population   19987071\n 3 Afghanistan  2000 cases            2666\n 4 Afghanistan  2000 population   20595360\n 5 Brazil       1999 cases           37737\n 6 Brazil       1999 population  172006362\n 7 Brazil       2000 cases           80488\n 8 Brazil       2000 population  174504898\n 9 China        1999 cases          212258\n10 China        1999 population 1272915272\n11 China        2000 cases          213766\n12 China        2000 population 1280428583\n\n\nHere, we have columns containing more than one variable this time (type has both cases and population).\nLets check out pivot_wider to see how we can undo this and make our data tidy again\n\n?pivot_wider\n\nAgain, pivot_wider has a bunch of arguments, but this time there are really only two essential ones\n\nnames_from which denotes the column in which our new column names are stored\nvalues_from which denotes the column in which the values we will be filling our new columns with are stored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are fewer important arguments in pivot_wider - which one is missing its inverse from pivot_longer?\n\n\n\nLets see it in action\n\ntable2 |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 4\n  country      year  cases population\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071\n2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360\n3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362\n4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898\n5 China        1999 212258 1272915272\n6 China        2000 213766 1280428583\n\n\nWe have now seperated our variables into seperate columns, and now our rows each contain only one observation.

In more general terms, supercomputers provide high-performance computing (HPC) resources.\nThis is what Owens, one of the OSC supercomputers, physically looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some possible reasons to use a supercomputer instead of your own laptop or desktop:\n\nYour analyses take a long time to run, need large numbers of CPUs, or a large amount of memory.\nYou need to run some analyses many times.\nYou need to store a lot of data.\nYour analyses require specialized hardware, such as GPUs (Graphical Processing Units).\nYour analyses require software available only for the Linux operating system, but you use Windows.\n\n\nThe Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) is a facility provided by the state of Ohio. It has three supercomputers, lots of storage space, and an excellent infrastructure for accessing these resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSC websites and ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù\n\n\n\nOSC has three main websites ‚Äî we will mostly or only use the first:\n\nhttps://ondemand.osc.edu: A web portal to use OSC resources through your browser (login needed).\nhttps://my.osc.edu: Account and project management (login needed).\nhttps://osc.edu: General website with information about the supercomputers, installed software, and usage.\n\n\nAccess to OSC‚Äôs computing power and storage space goes through OSC ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù:\n\nA project can be tied to a research project or lab, or be educational like Code Club‚Äôs project, PAS1838.\nEach project has a budget in terms of ‚Äúcompute hours‚Äù and storage space1.\nAs a user, it‚Äôs possible to be a member of multiple different projects."

OSC currently has three: ‚ÄúPitzer‚Äù, ‚ÄúOwens‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCardinal‚Äù.\nSupercomputer Center\nA facility like OSC that has one or more supercomputers.\n\n\n\nSupercomputer components\nWe can think of a supercomputer as having three main parts:\n\nFile Systems: Where files are stored (these are shared between the two OSC supercomputers!)\nLogin Nodes: The handful of computers everyone shares after logging in\nCompute Nodes: The many computers you can reserve to run your analyses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin Nodes\nLogin nodes are set aside as an initial landing spot for everyone who logs in to a supercomputer. There are only a handful of them on each supercomputer, they are shared among everyone, and cannot be ‚Äúreserved‚Äù.\nAs such, login nodes are meant only to do things like organizing your files and creating scripts for compute jobs, and are not meant for any serious computing, which should be done on the compute nodes.\n\n\nCompute Nodes\nData processing and analysis is done on compute nodes. You can only use compute nodes after putting in a request for resources (a ‚Äújob‚Äù). (The Slurm job scheduler, will then assign resources to your request.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat works differently on a supercomputer like at OSC? (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to command-line computing on a laptop or desktop, a number of aspects are different when working on a supercomputer like at OSC. We‚Äôll learn much more about these later on in the course, but here is an overview:\n\n‚ÄúNon-interactive‚Äù computing is common\nIt is common to write and ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù scripts to a queue instead of running programs interactively.\nSoftware\nYou generally can‚Äôt install ‚Äúthe regular way‚Äù, and a lot of installed software needs to be ‚Äúloaded‚Äù.\nOperating system\nSupercomputers run on the Linux operating system.\nLogin versus compute nodes\nAs mentioned, the nodes you end up on after logging in are not meant for heavy computing and you have to request access to ‚Äúcompute nodes‚Äù to run most analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSC file systems (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nOSC has several distinct file systems:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile system\nLocated within\nQuota\nBacked up?\nAuto-purged?\nOne for each‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\nHome\n/users/\n500 GB / 1 M files\nYes\nNo\nUser\n\n\nProject\n/fs/ess/\nFlexible\nYes\nNo\nOSC Project\n\n\nScratch\n/fs/scratch/\n100 TB\nNo\nAfter 90 days\nOSC Project\n\n\n\n(Directory is just another word for folder, often written as ‚Äúdir‚Äù for short.)"

    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe source documents for your website‚Äôs pages are in the Quarto (.qmd) format. Today, we will learn more about options to format Quarto documents, and to include code and its output.\nAs we have mentioned before, Quarto is a type of Markdown format (and essentially the successor to ‚ÄúR Markdown‚Äù) with extensions such as:\n\nMaking it possible to include executable code and its results. This code will typically be R code, but Quarto also supports Python, for instance.\nA more extensive set of built-in formatting options, like ‚Äúcallout boxes‚Äù and ‚Äútabsets‚Äù, which we‚Äôll see today.\n\nYour website‚Äôs Quarto documents will all produce HTML output, and this is also the default (and generally preferred) output format for stand-alone Quarto documents, but it is also possible to output to Word and PDF formats.\nA common use case for stand-alone Quarto documents is a digital notebook or report that includes results produced by R code. If you use R to produce some results and/or figures that you need to share or compile with accompanying notes, then using Quarto to do so is a lot easier, more robust, and reproducible than copying and pasting figures into (e.g.) a Powerpoint document.\nBecause it‚Äôs straightforward to make the output look polished, and because you can include citations too, it is also a good option for more formal reports and even manuscripts. As mentioned last week, you can also output a slide deck, and it is even possible to include these directly on your website since the output format for slides can be HTML.\nWe will continue to use RStudio‚Äôs Visual Editor, and will basically make our way through the options in the bar that is right above your main editor window (but only when you‚Äôre in ‚ÄúVisual‚Äù mode):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Creating a document for practice\nI will start by creating a new Quarto document to practice using these features. If you want to follow along:\n\nIn RStudio, click ‚ÄúFile‚Äù =&gt; ‚ÄúNew File‚Äù =&gt; ‚ÄúQuarto Document‚Äù.\nCheck the box ‚ÄúUse visual markdown editor‚Äù, and optionally add a Title and an Author."

Recall that headers will:\n\nBe numbered if you use the YAML option number-sections: true either site-wide (in _quarto.yml) or at the top of your focal document\nShow up in a Table of Contents if you use the YAML option toc: true.\nBy default have ‚Äúanchors‚Äù that you can see when you hover over or near them in the output.

When the pop-up window asks you to type the name of a language, you can type ‚ÄúR‚Äù, but this information is only used for code formatting purposes. These kind of blocks can be useful if you just want to demonstrate/explain some code:\nx &lt;- 5\nx * 6\nBy contrast, the ‚ÄúExecutable Cell‚Äù item (again, choose ‚ÄúR‚Äù as the language) will produce blocks also known as ‚ÄúCode Chunks‚Äù, which contain code that can be executed. By default, the code will in fact be executed and its results (if any) will be printed below the code chunk:\n\nx &lt;- 5\nx * 6\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nBecause code output consisting of just a number is a little boring, let‚Äôs insert a chunk with the following code, which will produce a plot ‚Äî and that plot will similarly be shown below the code as follows:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = iris,\n       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶Or a chunk that produces a simple table: in this case, simply the first lines of the iris dataframe.

That way, code will not be shown by default, but can be shown for each individual code chunk by unfolding it. This is great when you want to emphasize your results, but do want make the underlying code available to anyone who might be interested.\nFor example, for the plot we produced above, if we set code-folding to true, it would produce a box like this above the plot ‚Äî and clicking on that box would then show the code:"

    "section": "3 Sorting with arrange()",
    "text": "3 Sorting with arrange()\nThe arrange() function is like the sort function in Excel: it changes the order of the rows based on the values in one or more columns. For example, you might want to sort entries by their cost or size, or by their names in alphabetical order.\nWe‚Äôll see a first example using the diamonds data frame. Keep in mind that in this data frame, each row represents a single diamond, and the columns provide different pieces of information about a diamond:\n\n# Note the initial order in the 'carat' column:\nhead(diamonds)\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 10\n  carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  0.23 Ideal     E     SI2      61.5    55   326  3.95  3.98  2.43\n2  0.21 Premium   E     SI1      59.8    61   326  3.89  3.84  2.31\n3  0.23 Good      E     VS1      56.9    65   327  4.05  4.07  2.31\n4  0.29 Premium   I     VS2      62.4    58   334  4.2   4.23  2.63\n5  0.31 Good      J     SI2      63.3    58   335  4.34  4.35  2.75\n6  0.24 Very Good J     VVS2     62.8    57   336  3.94  3.96  2.48\n\n\nTherefore, sorting this data frame means rearranging the order of the diamonds based on their properties ‚Äî in the example below, based on the carat of the diamond:\n\n# Now, we'll sort by the values in the 'carat' column:\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 √ó 10\n   carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1   0.2 Premium   E     SI2      60.2    62   345  3.79  3.75  2.27\n 2   0.2 Premium   E     VS2      59.8    62   367  3.79  3.77  2.26\n 3   0.2 Premium   E     VS2      59      60   367  3.81  3.78  2.24\n 4   0.2 Premium   E     VS2      61.1    59   367  3.81  3.78  2.32\n 5   0.2 Premium   E     VS2      59.7    62   367  3.84  3.8   2.28\n 6   0.2 Ideal     E     VS2      59.7    55   367  3.86  3.84  2.3 \n 7   0.2 Premium   F     VS2      62.6    59   367  3.73  3.71  2.33\n 8   0.2 Ideal     D     VS2      61.5    57   367  3.81  3.77  2.33\n 9   0.2 Very Good E     VS2      63.4    59   367  3.74  3.71  2.36\n10   0.2 Ideal     E     VS2      62.2    57   367  3.76  3.73  2.33\n# ‚Ñπ 53,930 more rows\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are many rows with the same, smallest value of carat, so we may be interested in sorting by an additional column, which will break the ties in our first sorting column:\n\n# Sort first by carat, then by cut:\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  arrange(carat, cut)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 √ó 10\n   carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1   0.2 Very Good E     VS2      63.4    59   367  3.74  3.71  2.36\n 2   0.2 Premium   E     SI2      60.2    62   345  3.79  3.75  2.27\n 3   0.2 Premium   E     VS2      59.8    62   367  3.79  3.77  2.26\n 4   0.2 Premium   E     VS2      59      60   367  3.81  3.78  2.24\n 5   0.2 Premium   E     VS2      61.1    59   367  3.81  3.78  2.32\n 6   0.2 Premium   E     VS2      59.7    62   367  3.84  3.8   2.28\n 7   0.2 Premium   F     VS2      62.6    59   367  3.73  3.71  2.33\n 8   0.2 Premium   D     VS2      62.3    60   367  3.73  3.68  2.31\n 9   0.2 Premium   D     VS2      61.7    60   367  3.77  3.72  2.31\n10   0.2 Ideal     E     VS2      59.7    55   367  3.86  3.84  2.3 \n# ‚Ñπ 53,930 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Does the resulting order of entries in the cut column make sense to you? If not, what might be going on? (Click to see the solution)\n\nClearly, the order is not alphabetical, but it could be so in descending order ‚Äî though this is not in fact the case.\nAs we briefly saw last week, the cut column (as well as the color and clarity columns) are of the ‚Äúordered factor‚Äù type: therefore, when we sort by this column, the order as initially defined by whoever created this data frame will be respected:\n\nhead(diamonds$cut)\n\n[1] Ideal     Premium   Good      Premium   Good      Very Good\nLevels: Fair &lt; Good &lt; Very Good &lt; Premium &lt; Ideal\n\n\nThis also implies that there are no 0.2-carat (the lowest value) diamonds with Fair or Good cuts, because the first-listed and therefore lowest cut was Very Good.\n\n\nBy default, the sorting is done in ascending order (small-to-big), as you probably expected. But of course we may sometimes want to sort in descending (big-to-small) order, which we can do with the desc() helper function:\n\n# Sort first by carat, then by price:\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(carat))\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 √ó 10\n   carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  5.01 Fair      J     I1       65.5    59 18018 10.7  10.5   6.98\n 2  4.5  Fair      J     I1       65.8    58 18531 10.2  10.2   6.72\n 3  4.13 Fair      H     I1       64.8    61 17329 10     9.85  6.43\n 4  4.01 Premium   I     I1       61      61 15223 10.1  10.1   6.17\n 5  4.01 Premium   J     I1       62.5    62 15223 10.0   9.94  6.24\n 6  4    Very Good I     I1       63.3    58 15984 10.0   9.94  6.31\n 7  3.67 Premium   I     I1       62.4    56 16193  9.86  9.81  6.13\n 8  3.65 Fair      H     I1       67.1    53 11668  9.53  9.48  6.38\n 9  3.51 Premium   J     VS2      62.5    59 18701  9.66  9.63  6.03\n10  3.5  Ideal     H     I1       62.8    57 12587  9.65  9.59  6.03\n# ‚Ñπ 53,930 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving the output?\n\n\n\nIn the examples above, and in all of today‚Äôs examples and exercises, we are simply printing the output data frame.

    "text": "6 Manipulating with mutate()\nLet‚Äôs take a look at the official mutate() documentation figure (üòõ):\n\n\n\nIllustration by Allison Horst\n\n\nIt says ‚Äúadd column(s), keep existing‚Äù and shows that a third column, C, is being added to a data frame.\n\n\nWhat do the values in column C appear to represent (compare with A and B)? (Click for the solution)\n\nColumn C appears to be columns A + B, e.g in the first row, 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nLet‚Äôs try to do something similar ‚Äìcreating a new column that is based on the values of other columns‚Äì with diamond dimensions. We‚Äôll add a column named volume that is generated by multiplying the length, width, and depth columns:\n\n# (I'm first using select just to limit the output that is printed)\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  select(x, y, z) |&gt;\n  mutate(volume = x * y * z)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 √ó 4\n       x     y     z volume\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  3.95  3.98  2.43   38.2\n 2  3.89  3.84  2.31   34.5\n 3  4.05  4.07  2.31   38.1\n 4  4.2   4.23  2.63   46.7\n 5  4.34  4.35  2.75   51.9\n 6  3.94  3.96  2.48   38.7\n 7  3.95  3.98  2.47   38.8\n 8  4.07  4.11  2.53   42.3\n 9  3.87  3.78  2.49   36.4\n10  4     4.05  2.39   38.7\n# ‚Ñπ 53,930 more rows\n\n\nAs you could see in above examples, the operation is executed in a (vectorized) row-wise fashion: the volume that we see in the first row was created by multiplying x, y and z in the first row, and so on.\nAlso note that the new column created by mutate() is (by default) added as the last column.\n\n\nInstead of creating a new column with mutate(), it is also possible to simply change the values in a column (without creating a new column) by assigning back to the same column name. For example, say that we wanted diamond length to be in cm instead of in mm:\n\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  select(x, y, z) |&gt;\n  mutate(x = x / 10)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 √ó 3\n       x     y     z\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 0.395  3.98  2.43\n 2 0.389  3.84  2.31\n 3 0.405  4.07  2.31\n 4 0.42   4.23  2.63\n 5 0.434  4.35  2.75\n 6 0.394  3.96  2.48\n 7 0.395  3.98  2.47\n 8 0.407  4.11  2.53\n 9 0.387  3.78  2.49\n10 0.4    4.05  2.39\n# ‚Ñπ 53,930 more rows"

    "text": "1 Introduction\nToday we are going to learn how to make a presentation using Quarto. We will go over how to:\n\nCreate a Quarto presentation document\nAlter the YAMl to change your theming\nCreate slides\n\nHere you can find a demo presentation that will show you some of the options of things you can do in a Quarto presentation.\n\n\n2 Create a Quarto presentation\nOpen the project that contains your website. Then go to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Presentation. We are going to render our prsentation into a Reveal JS format (kind of like the presentation equivalent of .html). This is an open source .html format for presentations. Since we‚Äôve been using the visual markdown editor, check the box to use it now.\n\nSave this file in your website directory.\n\n\n3 The YAML\nWe will first look at the YAML.\ntitle: \"My practice presentation\"\nauthor: \"Jessica Cooperstone\"\nformat: revealjs\neditor: visual\nLet‚Äôs render the .qmd file to see what it looks like.\n\nIn your viewer, if you click on the hamburger in the bottom left corner, we can see:\n\nSlides: here we have our first slide, and an empty second slide\nTools: which let‚Äôs us view the slides in different way, and export them as a pdf\nClose: which just gets us out of this view\n\nWe can adjust our YAML to change the themeing of our slides by setting key:value pairs under format. Here are some that I‚Äôve set which renders like this:\ntitle: \"My practice presentation\"\nauthor: \"Jessica Cooperstone\"\nformat: \n  revealjs:\n    slide-number: true\n    logo: \"img/my-image.png\"\n    footer: \"I ‚ù§Ô∏è [Code Club](https://osu-codeclub.github.io/)\"\n    theme: moon\n    echo: true\n\nJust like there are\n\nslide-number can be true or false, and there are different formats of numbering to pick from.\nlogo allows you to specify a logo which will appear on the bottom right of your slide, I‚Äôve selected an image of the code slash\nfooter sets a footer which appears in the middle of your slides\ntheme can be set a preset themes for a presentation. Click here to see the full list. You can also set a theme by providing a .scss. file.\necho: true means by default all code will be shown, this is the default\n\nYou can find the full list of all the options for revealjs here.\nThe settings of your YAML will inherit for your whole presentation, unless you override any options for an individual slide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs all try playing around with our YAML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Creating slides\nYou can add a slide by creating a level 2 header (by using two hashtags), or if you‚Äôre in the visual editor, you can click on Normal &gt; Header 2. This will insert a slide.\n\nIf we toggle back to Source you can see that just two ## have been added. You might find typing this easier than setting a Header 2.\nWhat we type here in Heading 2 will be the title of our slide.\n\nIf you wanted to make a bulleted list, you can use the visual editor to insert bullets, and add some content.\n\nTry rendering this to see what happens.\n\nIf you click back and forth in your viewer, you will see that both items in the bulleted list appear together. If you want bullets to populate one at a time, you can set incremental: true in your YAML, or if you just want the bullets to increment in this slide only, you can set it by clicking on the three dots on the right of your slide, and setting Classes to be .incremental. You can learn more about incremental lists here. If you toggle between the visual and source editor, you can see what code you‚Äôd need to type to get your bullets to be incremental.\n\nThis is what your incremented slide would look like in the source editor.\n## The title of my second slide\n\n::: incremental\n-   The first item in my list\n-   A second item in my list\n:::\nOne of the main reasons you might want to create a Quarto presentation is because you want to show code. Just like we talked about last week, you can add a code chunk by clicking Insert &gt; Executable cell &gt; R to add an R code chunk.\nYou can type whatever code you want, here I am putting in some code that makes a plot. I am setting at the top of the chunk that I want the output to be on the next slide, since the code is a little long and the plot is a little big.\nA the top of a code chunk, you can set the options for that chunk after #| at the top of that chunk.\n#| output-location: slide\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npenguins %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Penguin species\",\n       y = \"Flipper length, in mm\",\n       title = \"Penguin flipper length by species\")\nWhen this renders, it looks like this:\n\n\nWe can also make it so that the code is collapsable, like this:\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Click for the full code\"\n\npenguins %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Penguin species\",\n       y = \"Flipper length, in mm\",\n       title = \"Penguin flipper length by species\")\nWhen rendered, it looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs all try playing around with creating slides and modifying them. Is there anything specific anyone wants to know how to do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "2 What are vectorized operations?\nI think its easier to see üëÄ an example of a vectorized operation, and then we can explain what is happening under the hood.\nLet‚Äôs create a vector of high temperatures for the weather in Columbus OH in Fahrenheit from the last 7 days. I took this data from January 19 to 25, 2024.\n\ntemps_F &lt;- c(26, 21, 24, 32, 33, 41, 51)\n\nWe can call our vector to see what it contains.\n\ntemps_F\n\n[1] 26 21 24 32 33 41 51\n\n\nA reminder that:\n\\[\n¬∞F = 1.8 * ¬∞C + 32\n\\]\nWith some light rearrangement, we can write the code below so we can plug in a temp in Fahrenheit, and get out one in Celsius.\n\ntemps_C &lt;- (temps_F - 32)/1.8\n\ntemps_C\n\n[1] -3.3333333 -6.1111111 -4.4444444  0.0000000  0.5555556  5.0000000 10.5555556\n\n\nHere, we simply use the vector temps_F as we would any single number in a smple mathematical operation, and we convert each element or number in our our entire vector using the formula we provide. As a result, we can convert every element of our vector from Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that this is unique in R - many other programming languages would require a for loop or similar to do this operation, but because R is a vectorized language, this works easily and simply.\n\nHere is another example. Imagine you have a vector of values and you want to calculate the log base 2 value for each element.\n\nraw &lt;- c(20, 36, 42, 53)\n\nlog2 &lt;- log2(raw)\n\nlog2\n\n[1] 4.321928 5.169925 5.392317 5.727920\n\n\nThis is an example where we apply a formula transformation to a vector, but we can also use vectorized operations with two vectors."

Note I am not using the c() function to create the vector - since I am using the : to indicate a string of integers from number 1 to number 2, under the hood, R automatically makes this a vector.

    "text": "6 What is a data frame?\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow I am creating a simple data frame, this is a rectangular data object with rows and columns. In reality, you will probably be reading your data in from a .csv or .xlsx file, but you can also construct a data frame directly in R. We are doing this with the function data.frame() which is a part of base R.\n\n# create a simple 3 by 4 data frame called small_df\n# columns are a, b, and c\n# values are numbers from 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 12\nsmall_df &lt;- data.frame(a = 1:4, \n                       b = 5:8, \n                       c = 9:12)\n\nLet‚Äôs look at small_df.\n\nsmall_df\n\n  a b  c\n1 1 5  9\n2 2 6 10\n3 3 7 11\n4 4 8 12\n\n\nWe can think about a data frame as being composed of a series of vectors (as columns) squished together. In the case above, each column is of the same type, integer or numeric but this doesn‚Äôt have to be true. Note the first column of 1:4 is actually the row index - you can tell this as it doesn‚Äôt have a column name.\n\nVectors all must be of the same object type (i.e., character, numeric, logical). In a data frame, each column can be a different object type. This is very useful especially when you have to have meta-data combined with numeric data.\n\nWe call use some new functions to look more at our data frame.\nView() will open our data frame like you might be used to looking at a spreadsheet in Excel.\n\nView(small_df)\n\nstr() gives us the structure of the object x.\n\nstr(small_df)\n\n'data.frame':   4 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ a: int  1 2 3 4\n $ b: int  5 6 7 8\n $ c: int  9 10 11 12\n\n\ndim() gives us the dimensions of x.\n\ndim(small_df)\n\n[1] 4 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when referring to a two-dimensional piece of data, R uses the syntax [rows, columns]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, that if you use dim() on a vector (which has only one dimension), you will get something unexpected.\n\n# this doesn't work\ndim(temps_C)\n\nNULL\n\n\nFor a vector, instead you should use the function length() to figure out how many elements are in the vector.\n\n# this does work\nlength(temps_C)\n\n[1] 7"

    "text": "7 Performing operations on a data frame\nNow that we have our small_df we can try performing some operations on it.\nWhat if you wanted to take the log base 2 for every value in small_df? Just like we did for a vector, we can simply use the function log2() on small_df. Here I am assigning the output of this to a new data frame called small_df_log2.\n\n(small_df_log2 &lt;- log2(small_df))\n\n         a        b        c\n1 0.000000 2.321928 3.169925\n2 1.000000 2.584963 3.321928\n3 1.584963 2.807355 3.459432\n4 2.000000 3.000000 3.584963\n\n\nRemember, if you assign something to an object, but also want it to print at the same time, just surround the whole thing in parentheses.\nWhat if I wanted to take the log base 2 of only column a? There are a few ways I can do that.\n\n7.1 By indexing\nI can use the square brackets [] to access certain parts of my data frame. Remember for data frames, the syntax is [rows, columns]. Let‚Äôs try some example where we access by using indices (i.e., the position of the row, column, or the combination) to grab different parts of our data frame.\n\n# first row, second column\nsmall_df[1,2]\n\n[1] 5\n\n# all rows, second column\nsmall_df[,2]\n\n[1] 5 6 7 8\n\n# third row, all columns\nsmall_df[3,]\n\n  a b  c\n3 3 7 11\n\n\nIs there any difference as to the types of objects we get when doing these different types of selection? We can use the function str() to see what type of R object we have in the different scenarios.\n\n# first row, second column\nstr(small_df[1,2])\n\n int 5\n\n# all rows, second column\nstr(small_df[,2])\n\n int [1:4] 5 6 7 8\n\n# third row, all columns\nstr(small_df[3,])\n\n'data.frame':   1 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ a: int 3\n $ b: int 7\n $ c: int 11\n\n\nBack to the original idea - how would we take the data only from column a and log base 2 transform it, but leave the rest of small_df as it is?\n\n# first save our df with a new name\n# this is like doing a \"save as\" for an existing df\nsmall_df_log2_a &lt;- small_df\n\n# log2 transform the first column, and then assign that back to the first column\nsmall_df_log2_a[,1] &lt;- log2(small_df[,1])\n\n# check to see if it worked\nsmall_df_log2_a\n\n         a b  c\n1 0.000000 5  9\n2 1.000000 6 10\n3 1.584963 7 11\n4 2.000000 8 12\n\n\nNote that column a now is the object type ‚Äúdbl‚Äù or numeric, instead of ‚Äúint‚Äù or integer, since our log2 transformation has made our values no longer integers.\n\n\n7.2 By name\nWe can also index by providing column names - this is a nice approach since when going back to read code, a column name is often more informative than a column index/number. Note that in this case the column name a is in quotes since it is a character string.\n\n# all rows, the column \"a\"\nsmall_df[,\"a\"]\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nWe can also use the dollar sign accessor $ to extract an element in a data frame or list. In the case of a data frame, you are accessing a column (though you could be accessing something else if a different type of object). Note that when you type the name of a data frame, and then the $, R will prompt you with some possible column names.\n\n\nsmall_df$a\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nBy using this syntax, you are turning your data frame into a vector. This may or may not be what you want to do, so just be aware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing certain observations can also be performed using the tidyverse functions select() and filter(). If you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about simply ignore this, we will go over it in a future Code Club."

    "text": "2 Basic maps\n\nMap data to draw states in the US\nWhen plotting maps, we typically need a base map that has outlines like administrative borders and coastlines. For today‚Äôs maps, we will get this type of map data through ggplot2‚Äôs map_data() function.\nLet‚Äôs get a dataframe with the outlines of the lower 48 states of the US (i.e.¬†no Alaska or Hawaii), and take a look at what it contains:\n\nstates &lt;- map_data(map = \"state\")\n\nhead(states)\n\n       long      lat group order  region subregion\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nEach row in this dataframe makes up a single point along the outline of a state:\n\nThe long and lat columns contain longitudes and latitudes in decimal format. In the US, all longitudes are negative as we are west of the prime meridian that runs through the UK, and all latitudes are positive as we are north of the equator.\nThe group column groups the rows (points) into shapes/‚Äúpolygons‚Äù that outline the borders of a state, or in some cases, parts of a state1. (This is complemented by the order column which provides the drawing order.)\nThe region column contains the state name.\n\n\n\n\nRecall: latitude (left) determines the position along the north-south axis, and longitude (right) the position along the east-west axis. Source: Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first map\nTo make a first map, we pass our dataframe to ggplot as per usual, and then use the geom geom_polygon() to draw the polygons that make up the states, mapping:\n\nLongitude (long, east-west axis) to the x aesthetic\nLatitude (lat, north-south axis) to the y aesthetic\n\n\nggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt look so good ‚Äì what could be the problem here?\nWe need to tell ggplot which groups of points together form discrete shapes like an individual state‚Äôs outline, and can do so by additionally mapping our data frame‚Äôs group column to the plot‚Äôs group aesthetic:\n\nggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch better!\n\n\n\nMap projections\nWhen creating maps, especially for large geographic areas like the world, continents, or big countries like the US, you need to consider the ‚Äúprojection‚Äù. We will not go into the details of map projections here, but will note that:\n\nDifferent projections are suitable for different geographic areas\nThe ggplot function coord_sf() sets a geographic coordinate system for the plot and with it‚Äôs argument crs (Coordinate Reference System, CRS), we can set the specific projection.\nCRS projections have numbers, e.g.:\n\n5070 is a projection suitable for the lower 48\n4326 is what GPS coordinates like those in our states dataframe are based on\n\nBelow, we‚Äôll use coord_sf(crs = 5070, default_crs = 4326), to state that:\n\nWe want to plot the map with the 5070 CRS\nOur data has 4326-style GPS coordinates\n\n\nIn the map below, note the curvature of especially the latitudinal lines, which we didn‚Äôt have before:\n\nggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  coord_sf(crs = 5070, default_crs = 4326)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap theming\nWith maps, more basic themes like theme_minimal() or theme_void() tend to look better since we‚Äôre often not that interested in the background panel and the axes.\n\nWith theme_minimal():\n\n\n# Code is the same as above, just with `theme_minimal()` added:\nggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  coord_sf(crs = 5070, default_crs = 4326) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith theme_void(), which omits the plotting panel and axis altogether:\n\n\n# Code is the same as above, just with `theme_void()` added:\nggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  coord_sf(crs = 5070, default_crs = 4326) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you make many plots that should have similar theming, a nice ggplot trick is to set an overall theme for the entire session with the theme_set() function, and optionally modify that with the theme_update() function. Let‚Äôs do that here, so we don‚Äôt have to keep adding the theme_void() line to every plot ‚Äî and we‚Äôre also saying that we want any legends above the plot rather than besides it:\n\ntheme_set(theme_void())\ntheme_update(legend.position = \"top\")\n\nWe may also want to change the fill and outline colors of the states ‚Äî and let‚Äôs save this map as an object p so we can build on it in the next section:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey85\", color = \"grey40\", linewidth = 0.1) +\n  coord_sf(crs = 5070, default_crs = 4326)\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1\nA) Create a map that does not have visible state lines. While you‚Äôre at it, you can also play around with the settings inside geom_polygon() to get a map look that you like ‚Äî or one that you hate, just for the fun of it. And how about a map with a blue panel background? After all, most (but not all) of the area surrounding the US is water.\n\n\nClick to see some examples\n\n\nYou can make sure that the state lines aren‚Äôt visible by providing the same color for the color and fill aesthetics:\n\n\nggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"palevioletred\", color = \"palevioletred\") +\n  coord_sf(crs = 5070, default_crs = 4326)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should the map look good, anyway?\n\n\nggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"darkred\", linewidth = 1) +\n  coord_sf(crs = 5070, default_crs = 4326)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blue panel background:\n\n\nggplot(states) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey85\", color = \"grey40\", linewidth = 0.1) +\n  coord_sf(crs = 5070, default_crs = 4326) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"dodgerblue\", color = \"grey20\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB) Still using the states data frame as a starting point, can you make a map that only shows Ohio?

    "text": "3 Adding points and text to maps\n\nAdding single points and bits of text\nWe can add points to a map with the familiar geom geom_point(). We have used this to make scatterplots, but it can plot single points too.\nAs a first example, we‚Äôll just add a single point to show where the city of Columbus is, and set its coordinates on the fly (note, we‚Äôre not using aes()). We‚Äôll use the OSU scarlet color via it‚Äôs Hex code as the color for the point:\n\np +\n  geom_point(x = -82.99, y = 39.99, colour = \"#ba0c2f\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can pretty easily add arbitrary text in a similar fashion with geom_text(), in which we specify the text we want to print using the label argument ‚Äî note that I‚Äôm subtracting 1 from the latitude so the text ends up a bit below the point and not right on top of it:\n\np +\n  geom_point(x = -82.99, y = 39.99, colour = \"#ba0c2f\", size = 4) +\n  geom_text(x = -82.99, y = 39.99 - 1, label = \"Columbus\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a set of points from a data frame\nIn your research, you may want to make a map that plots sampling locations. As a simple fictional example, we can create a dataframe with four sampling locations, a grouping factor (season), and a column with a numerical result for each location (yield):\n\nlocations &lt;- data.frame(\n  location = c(\"L01\", \"L02\", \"L03\", \"L04\"),\n  long = c(-80, -100, -90, -110),\n  lat = c(35, 33, 45, 43),\n  season = c(\"winter\", \"winter\", \"summer\", \"summer\"),\n  yield = c(21, 94, 39, 62)\n)\n\nlocations\n\n  location long lat season yield\n1      L01  -80  35 winter    21\n2      L02 -100  33 winter    94\n3      L03  -90  45 summer    39\n4      L04 -110  43 summer    62\n\n\nNow, we can add a layer to our saved plot p with the sampling locations ‚Äî note that:\n\nWe are giving geom_point() ‚Äúit‚Äôs own‚Äù data set with the data = argument\nWe map the fill aesthetic to the season column so we can distinguish samples from different seasons\nWe use point shape 21 (see this overview of R point shapes) which allows for a fill color as well as an outline color (the latter via color):\n\n\np +\n  geom_point(data = locations,\n             aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = season),\n             size = 4, shape = 21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2\nBuild on the previous map by making the appearance of the sampling location points reflect the values in the yield column. For example, higher yields could produce larger points, or the fill color of the points could depend on the yield.\n\n\nClick here for some hints\n\n\nTo make points vary in size, use the size aesthetic aes(size = ...)\nTo make points vary in fill color, use the fill aesthetic and then switch to a different aesthetic for season, like point shape.\n\n\n\n\nClick here for possible solutions with point size\n\n\np + \n  geom_point(data = locations,\n             aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = season, size = yield),\n             shape = 21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat produces quite a small point for the location with the lowest yield ‚Äì we could restrict the size range of the points like so:\n\np + \n  geom_point(data = locations,\n             aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = season, size = yield),\n             shape = 21) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2.5, 6))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for possible solutions with point fill color\n\nIf we want to use fill color instead for yield, we‚Äôll need another aesthetic for season, e.g.¬†shape:\n\np + \n  geom_point(data = locations,\n             aes(x = long, y = lat, shape = season, fill = yield),\n             size = 4) +\n  # Make sure the shapes support a fill color (the default ones don't):\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21, 23))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the fill color scale to one of the viridis color scales:\n\np + \n  geom_point(data = locations,\n             aes(x = long, y = lat, shape = season, fill = yield),\n             size = 4) +\n  # Make sure the shapes support a fill color (the default ones don't):\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21, 23)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"inferno\")"

Those numbers are quite low making this a relatively low-resolution map ‚Äî but good enough for our purposes.\n\n\nA base map of Ohio\nNow we are ready to plot our map of Ohio:\n\np_ohio &lt;- ggplot(ohio) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey90\", color = \"grey70\") +\n  coord_sf()\n\np_ohio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now use this as a base map to plot points on, like we did above with the US map. Or we could create a map where counties differ in fill color depending on some variable, like the number of farms or eagle nests in each county.\n\n\n\nAdding county names\nFor now, without pulling in additional data, say that we want to print the county names in the map.\nTo do so, we will start by transforming the county names to ‚ÄúTitle Case‚Äù from the original all-lowercase using the tools::toTitleCase() function ‚Äî and let‚Äôs also use the name county (instead of subregion for that new column):\n\nohio &lt;- ohio |&gt; mutate(county = tools::toTitleCase(subregion))\n\nWe‚Äôd also need a single pair of coordinates for each county, because we only want to print each county name once. A quick-and-dirty way to get those is to simply compute the mean of the longitude and latitude of the points in the dataframe that make up the borders.\n\ncounty_coords &lt;- ohio |&gt;\n  summarize(long = mean(long), lat = mean(lat), .by = county)\n\nhead(county_coords)\n\n     county      long      lat\n1     Adams -83.46984 38.82059\n2     Allen -84.12130 40.79424\n3   Ashland -82.29662 40.86571\n4 Ashtabula -80.75319 41.80821\n5    Athens -81.98483 39.35768\n6  Auglaize -84.20080 40.54607\n\n\nNow, we can add the county labels to the plot:\n\np_ohio +\n  geom_text(data = county_coords,\n            aes(x = long, y = lat, label = county),\n            color = \"darkblue\", size = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat‚Äôs not perfect (those ‚Äúmean coordinates‚Äù are not actual centroids), but not bad for a quick-and-dirty attempt!\n\n\n\n Exercise 3\nA) OSU has campuses in the following places:\n\nColumbus, Franklin County\nWooster, Wayne County\nLima, Allen County\nMansfield, Richland County\nMarion, Marion County\nNewark, Licking County\n\nCan you create a map similar to our previous one, but then with only these 6 counties labeled by name? Like in the example below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for some hints\n\n\nYou‚Äôll have to filter() the county_coords data frame to only keep the counties of interest.\nAfter that, the plotting code will be identical to that for the previous map, just make sure you pass the correct, filtered data frame.\nIf you‚Äôre printing the names of the counties, then you won‚Äôt want a fill legend: you can turn that off using guides(fill = \"none\").\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the solution\n\n\nFirst we filter the county_coords to only keep our focal counties, and store the result in a new data frame:\n\n\nfocal_counties &lt;- c(\"Franklin\", \"Wayne\", \"Allen\",\n                    \"Richland\", \"Marion\", \"Licking\") \n\ncounty_coords_sel &lt;- county_coords |&gt;\n  filter(county %in% focal_counties)\n\n\nWe use the same plotting code as before, but now with county_coords_sel:\n\n\np_ohio +\n  geom_text(data = county_coords_sel,\n            aes(x = long, y = lat, label = county),\n            color = \"darkblue\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB) (Bonus) Can you produce a map that has a different fill color for each county, like the one below?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for some hints\n\n\nYou‚Äôll want to keep the original geom_polygon() layer with the gray counties, and then add a second geom_polygon() layer just with the focal counties.\nIn that second layer, map the county column to the fill aesthetic.\nMake sure to add the geom_text() layer last, or it would be masked by the polygon layer.\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the solution\n\n\np_ohio +\n  geom_polygon(data = ohio |&gt; filter(county %in% focal_counties),\n               aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = county),\n               color = \"grey70\") +\n  geom_text(data = county_coords_sel,\n            aes(x = long, y = lat, label = county),\n            color = \"darkblue\", size = 4) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")"

Wide data tends to get wide very quickly.\n\nFor an example of very wide data, look at the who dataset\n\ndata(who)\n who\n\n# A tibble: 7,240 √ó 60\n   country  iso2  iso3   year new_sp_m014 new_sp_m1524 new_sp_m2534 new_sp_m3544\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1980          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 2 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1981          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 3 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1982          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 4 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1983          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 5 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1984          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 6 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1985          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 7 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1986          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 8 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1987          NA           NA           NA           NA\n 9 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1988          NA           NA           NA           NA\n10 Afghani‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1989          NA           NA           NA           NA\n# ‚Ñπ 7,230 more rows\n# ‚Ñπ 52 more variables: new_sp_m4554 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_m5564 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_m65 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f014 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f1524 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_f2534 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f3544 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f4554 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_f5564 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f65 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m014 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sn_m1524 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m2534 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m3544 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sn_m4554 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m5564 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m65 &lt;dbl&gt;, ‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nTo make this data tidy, we need to the the column names (the year variable) and turn it into its own column (called year), and take all of the population data and put that into a second variable column (called population)\nPreviously with the classroom data we did this manually, but there is a much better way to pivot from wide messy data, to longer tidy data with the function pivot_longer\nLets look at the help file for it\n\n?pivot_longer\n\nFrom this, we see that the pivot_longer function can take a lot of aruguments, but there are only a few important ones\n\ncols, in which we select the columns to pivot (i.e., the columns whos names contain a variable)\nnames_to, in which we create a new column for where our old column names are to be put into\nvalues_to, in which we create a second new column for the values to be put into\n\nHere‚Äôs what that looks like in our example\n\ntidy_table4b &lt;- table4b |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = `1999`:`2000`, \n               names_to = \"year\", \n               values_to = \"population\") \n\n# note here the numbers are in backticks. This is because R treats column names as characters, and calling a name as number data won't work here. \n\n# the new column names also need to be in quotes here\n\ntidy_table4b\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 3\n  country     year  population\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan 1999    19987071\n2 Afghanistan 2000    20595360\n3 Brazil      1999   172006362\n4 Brazil      2000   174504898\n5 China       1999  1272915272\n6 China       2000  1280428583\n\n\nusing pivot_longer we turned a 3x3 table where the column names stored variable values into a 6x3 table where each column contains a single variable, and each row a single observation - and presto, tidy data!\nOne other thing to note here is that we are not pivoting every column. In some datasets you may only have a few columns that you would like to be longer\n\n4.1.1 More examples and uses of pivot\nPivoting isn‚Äôt just for cleaning up! When combined with other functions, pivoting can also be a very useful way to manipulate data to make it easier to analyze\nLast week, we used the summary function to find the mean height, width and depth of diamonds in the diamonds dataset\n\ndata(diamonds)\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_x = mean(x),\n            mean_y = mean(y),\n            mean_z = mean(z))\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 3\n  mean_x mean_y mean_z\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   5.73   5.73   3.54\n\n\nFor this we had to create a new column for every dimensional mean, which a.) takes a while to type, especially if we wanted to find the mean of further values and b.) comes out to not be tidy data\nAnother way to find the means for these columns is to use the pivot_longer function to make another column which we can group the values by\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \npivot_longer(cols = c(x:z), \n             names_to = \"dimension\", \n             values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_value = mean(value),\n            .by = dimension)\n\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 2\n  dimension mean_value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 x               5.73\n2 y               5.73\n3 z               3.54\n\n# note in cols, I'm not specifying x, y, and z individually. In the dataset they are all next to each other, so I can use the : operator to signify that I want columns x through z. This can be really helpful on wider datasets. \n\nHere we only have three values, but for wider datasets this can be a very powerful tool\n\n\n4.1.2 Pivot longer problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nMake the classroom data from earlier into a tidy format using pivot_longer\n\nclassroom &lt;- tribble(\n  ~name,    ~quiz1, ~quiz2, ~test1,\n  \"Billy\",  NA,     \"D\",    \"C\",\n  \"Suzy\",   \"F\",    NA,     NA,\n  \"Lionel\", \"B\",    \"C\",    \"B\",\n  \"Jenny\",  \"A\",    \"A\",    \"B\"\n  )\n\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\n\nclassroom |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(quiz1,quiz2, test1), \n               names_to = \"assesment\", \n               values_to = \"grade\")\n\n# A tibble: 12 √ó 3\n   name   assesment grade\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 Billy  quiz1     &lt;NA&gt; \n 2 Billy  quiz2     D    \n 3 Billy  test1     C    \n 4 Suzy   quiz1     F    \n 5 Suzy   quiz2     &lt;NA&gt; \n 6 Suzy   test1     &lt;NA&gt; \n 7 Lionel quiz1     B    \n 8 Lionel quiz2     C    \n 9 Lionel test1     B    \n10 Jenny  quiz1     A    \n11 Jenny  quiz2     A    \n12 Jenny  test1     B    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nFind the means, minimum values, maximum values, and standard deviations of all of the numeric columns in the diamonds dataset using pivot_longer followed by summarise\n\n\nHint (click here)\n\nWhich are the numeric columns?\n\nstr(diamonds)\n\ntibble [53,940 √ó 10] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ carat  : num [1:53940] 0.23 0.21 0.23 0.29 0.31 0.24 0.24 0.26 0.22 0.23 ...\n $ cut    : Ord.factor w/ 5 levels \"Fair\"&lt;\"Good\"&lt;..: 5 4 2 4 2 3 3 3 1 3 ...\n $ color  : Ord.factor w/ 7 levels \"D\"&lt;\"E\"&lt;\"F\"&lt;\"G\"&lt;..: 2 2 2 6 7 7 6 5 2 5 ...\n $ clarity: Ord.factor w/ 8 levels \"I1\"&lt;\"SI2\"&lt;\"SI1\"&lt;..: 2 3 5 4 2 6 7 3 4 5 ...\n $ depth  : num [1:53940] 61.5 59.8 56.9 62.4 63.3 62.8 62.3 61.9 65.1 59.4 ...\n $ table  : num [1:53940] 55 61 65 58 58 57 57 55 61 61 ...\n $ price  : int [1:53940] 326 326 327 334 335 336 336 337 337 338 ...\n $ x      : num [1:53940] 3.95 3.89 4.05 4.2 4.34 3.94 3.95 4.07 3.87 4 ...\n $ y      : num [1:53940] 3.98 3.84 4.07 4.23 4.35 3.96 3.98 4.11 3.78 4.05 ...\n $ z      : num [1:53940] 2.43 2.31 2.31 2.63 2.75 2.48 2.47 2.53 2.49 2.39 ...\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(carat,depth:z), \n               names_to = \"parameter\", \n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n  summarise(mean = mean(value),\n            min = min(value),\n            max = max(value),\n            sd = sd(value),\n            .by = parameter)\n\n# A tibble: 7 √ó 5\n  parameter     mean   min      max       sd\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 carat        0.798   0.2     5.01    0.474\n2 depth       61.7    43      79       1.43 \n3 table       57.5    43      95       2.23 \n4 price     3933.    326   18823    3989.   \n5 x            5.73    0      10.7     1.12 \n6 y            5.73    0      58.9     1.14 \n7 z            3.54    0      31.8     0.706\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 - Challange\n\n\n\nTake a look at the very wide dataset who\n\ndata(who)\n\nhead(who)\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 60\n  country   iso2  iso3   year new_sp_m014 new_sp_m1524 new_sp_m2534 new_sp_m3544\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanis‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1980          NA           NA           NA           NA\n2 Afghanis‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1981          NA           NA           NA           NA\n3 Afghanis‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1982          NA           NA           NA           NA\n4 Afghanis‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1983          NA           NA           NA           NA\n5 Afghanis‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1984          NA           NA           NA           NA\n6 Afghanis‚Ä¶ AF    AFG    1985          NA           NA           NA           NA\n# ‚Ñπ 52 more variables: new_sp_m4554 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_m5564 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_m65 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f014 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f1524 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_f2534 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f3544 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f4554 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sp_f5564 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sp_f65 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m014 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sn_m1524 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m2534 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m3544 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sn_m4554 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m5564 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_m65 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   new_sn_f014 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_f1524 &lt;dbl&gt;, new_sn_f2534 &lt;dbl&gt;, ‚Ä¶\n\n\nThis data contains records of the counts of confirmed tuberculosis cases by country, year, and demographic group.

    "text": "2 summarize()\n\n2.1 A first example\nThe summarize() function from the dplyr package can compute across-row data summaries. As a first example, here‚Äôs how you can compute the overall mean of the carat column:\n\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  summarize(carat_mean = mean(carat))\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 1\n  carat_mean\n       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      0.798\n\n\nAs you can see, this function has quite a different output from the dplyr functions we‚Äôd seen so far. All of those returned a manipulated version of our original dataframe, whereas summarize() returns a ‚Äúcompletely new‚Äù dataframe with a summary of the original data.\nHowever, summarizing across all rows at once with summarize() is much more verbose than the simple, base R:\n\nmean(diamonds$carat)\n\n[1] 0.7979397\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Summarizing by group\nThe real power of summarize() comes with its ability to compute group-wise summaries. For example, simply by adding .by = cut, it will calculate the mean carat separately for each value of cut:\n\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  summarize(carat_mean = mean(carat), .by = cut)\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 2\n  cut       carat_mean\n  &lt;ord&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Ideal          0.703\n2 Premium        0.892\n3 Good           0.849\n4 Very Good      0.806\n5 Fair           1.05 \n\n\nNice! We can also compute multiple summarized variables ‚Äî and use summarizing functions other than mean():\n\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  summarize(carat_mean = mean(carat),\n            carat_max = max(carat),\n            .by = cut)\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 3\n  cut       carat_mean carat_max\n  &lt;ord&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Ideal          0.703      3.5 \n2 Premium        0.892      4.01\n3 Good           0.849      3.01\n4 Very Good      0.806      4   \n5 Fair           1.05       5.01\n\n\nA handy helper function is n(), which will compute the number of rows for each group (i.e.¬†the group sizes, which can be good to know, for example so you don‚Äôt make unfounded conclusions based on really small sample sizes):\n\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  summarize(carat_mean = mean(carat),\n            n_diamonds = n(),\n            .by = cut)\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 3\n  cut       carat_mean n_diamonds\n  &lt;ord&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 Ideal          0.703      21551\n2 Premium        0.892      13791\n3 Good           0.849       4906\n4 Very Good      0.806      12082\n5 Fair           1.05        1610\n\n\nHere is an overview of the most commonly used functions to compute summaries:\n\nmean() & median()\nmin() & max()\nsum()\nsd(): standard deviation\nIQR(): interquartile range\nn(): counts the number of rows (observations)\nn_distinct(): counts the number of distinct (unique) values\n\nTwo other comments:\n\nYou can also ask summarize() to compute summaries by multiple columns, which will return separate summaries for each combination of the involved variables ‚Äî we‚Äôll see this in the exercises.\nThis may be obvious, but whatever column you are computing summaries by (using .by) should be a categorical variable. In our diamond examples, we‚Äôre only using columns that are factors, but ‚Äúregular‚Äù character columns will work just fine as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: group_by()\n\n\n\nThe ‚Äúclassic‚Äù way of using summarize() with multiple groups is by preceding it with a group_by() call ‚Äî e.g., the code below is equivalent to our last example above:\n\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(cut) |&gt; \n  summarize(carat_mean = mean(carat),\n            n_diamonds = n())\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 3\n  cut       carat_mean n_diamonds\n  &lt;ord&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 Fair           1.05        1610\n2 Good           0.849       4906\n3 Very Good      0.806      12082\n4 Premium        0.892      13791\n5 Ideal          0.703      21551\n\n\n\nThe .by argument to summarize() (and other functions!) is a rather recent addition, but I prefer it over group_by():\n\nIt is simpler, a bit less typing, and makes the summarize() call self-contained\nWhen grouping by multiple columns, group_by() has some odd, unhelpful behavior where it keeps some of the groupings, such that you likely need an ungroup() call as well."

    "text": "5 The count() function\nAbove, we used the n() helper with summarize() to get the number of rows with each value of cut (i.e.¬†the group sizes) along with other computed summaries.\nGetting a ‚Äúcount table‚Äù like that is such a common part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that there‚Äôs another dplyr function available for it, count(). And unless you‚Äôre already summarize-ing, this one is simpler to use:\n\ndiamonds |&gt; count(cut)\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 2\n  cut           n\n  &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Fair       1610\n2 Good       4906\n3 Very Good 12082\n4 Premium   13791\n5 Ideal     21551\n\n\nWe may also want to sort the output by frequency, which can be useful especially when there are many different values for the focal variable (not really the case here, but you get the point):\n\ndiamonds |&gt; count(cut, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 2\n  cut           n\n  &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Ideal     21551\n2 Premium   13791\n3 Very Good 12082\n4 Good       4906\n5 Fair       1610\n\n\nAnd you can also create counts for value combinations across multiple columns:\n\ndiamonds |&gt; count(cut, color)\n\n# A tibble: 35 √ó 3\n   cut   color     n\n   &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Fair  D       163\n 2 Fair  E       224\n 3 Fair  F       312\n 4 Fair  G       314\n 5 Fair  H       303\n 6 Fair  I       175\n 7 Fair  J       119\n 8 Good  D       662\n 9 Good  E       933\n10 Good  F       909\n# ‚Ñπ 25 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase R‚Äôs table() function\n\n\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the base R table() function, which is similar to count(). While its output format is unwieldy for follow-up analyses1, you may prefer its formatting especially when wanting to glance at a 2-way count table to see patterns:\n\ntable(diamonds$cut, diamonds$color)\n\n           \n               D    E    F    G    H    I    J\n  Fair       163  224  312  314  303  175  119\n  Good       662  933  909  871  702  522  307\n  Very Good 1513 2400 2164 2299 1824 1204  678\n  Premium   1603 2337 2331 2924 2360 1428  808\n  Ideal     2834 3903 3826 4884 3115 2093  896\n\n\n\nAdditionally, as a dplyr function, count() only works with data frames. Occasionally, you may also need to create a count table for a vector, and table() can do that:\n\ncut_vec &lt;- diamonds$cut\n\ntable(cut_vec)\n\ncut_vec\n     Fair      Good Very Good   Premium     Ideal \n     1610      4906     12082     13791     21551"

On Windows, this app seems to be simply called ‚ÄúSoftware Center‚Äù, whereas on Mac, it is called ‚ÄúOhio State Application Self Service‚Äù (names likely vary).\nIf you can‚Äôt find that application, or have trouble installing R and RStudio this way, you should contact OSU IT to help you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready have R installed?\n\n\n\n\nPlease check your version of R ‚Äì this information is printed to the console when you start R, and you can also get it by typing sessionInfo() and checking the first line of the output.\nCurrently (Spring 2025), we would recommend R version 4.3.0 or higher.\nTo update R, see the bottom of this page for instructions."

While it is perfectly possible to use R without RStudio, RStudio has become the de facto standard for working with R and is very useful.\nTo install RStudio, go to the RStudio download page and download and run the installer file for your operating system."

    "text": "3 Alternative: Use RStudio Server at OSC\nUpon request (contact Jelmer), you can get access to the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) Classroom Project for Code Club (PAS1838). This way, you can code in RStudio from your browser rather than with a local installation. This is a good option if you prefer not to install anything or if you run into problems during installations.\nAfter you asked for access to the OSC project, you should receive an email from OSC that you have been added to the Code Club OSC project.\n\nIf you already have an OSC account, you shouldn‚Äôt need to do anything to gain access, although the email may ask you to confirm/accept your being added to project.\nIf you do not yet have an OSC account, the email you received from OSC should have a link to do so. Alternatively, follow the instructions below to sign up and get access to the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun RStudio Server from the OSC OnDemand website (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nOSC OnDemand lets you access OSC resources through your browser and run applications like RStudio.\n\nTo get started, go to https://ondemand.osc.edu/ and log in with your OSC username and password.\nClick on ‚ÄúInteractive Apps‚Äù in the blue top bar, and select ‚ÄúRStudio Server‚Äù (near the bottom).\nNow, you‚Äôre on a page from which you can launch an RStudio server that will run on an OSC cluster. Select project PAS1838 in the dropdown menu and change the ‚ÄúNumber of hours‚Äù to 2. Then click ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù.\nYou will be sent to a page where you can see the status of your ‚Äújob‚Äù It usually starts running within seconds, and the color of the top bar will then switch from blue (‚ÄúQueued‚Äù and then ‚ÄúStarting‚Äù) to green (‚ÄúRunning‚Äù).\nClick ‚ÄúConnect to RStudio Server‚Äù at the bottom of the box, and an RStudio Server instance will open."

You can check which version of R you have by looking at the first lines of output when running the following command inside R:\nsessionInfo()\nTo update:\n\nWindows: You can update R from within R. The updateR() function will also take care of updating your packages:\ninstall.packages(\"installr\")\ninstallr::updateR()\nMac: Download and install the latest .pkg file as if you were installing R for the first time.\n\n\n\nRe-installing your packages after updating (Mac and Linux)\nWhile the installr::updateR() function for Windows users takes care of reinstalling your packages along with updating R, Mac and Linux users will have to manually re-install their packages. Some people prefer to re-install these packages on the fly, which can end up being a way to get rid of packages you no longer use.\nBut if you want immediately reinstall all your packages, run this before you upgrade:\nmy_packages &lt;- installed.packages()\nsaveRDS(my_packages, \"my_packages.rds\")\nThen, after you‚Äôve installed the latest R version:\nmy_packages &lt;- readRDS(\"CurrentPackages.rds\")\ninstall.packages(my_packages[1, ])\nThis will only work for packages available on CRAN. Of course, you can check your list for Github-only and Bioconductor packages and then install those with their respective commands (see below). Yes, this can be a bit of a hassle!"
