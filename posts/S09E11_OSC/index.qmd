## Today's content

Today, I will show you how to access resources such as R and RStudio through
the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC). 
To give some context, I will start with a brief general introduction to high-performance
computing and OSC.

Since this is the last Code CLub session of the semester,
we will also leave for more general questions and comments and ask for suggestions
for content for the next semester of Code Club.

## High-performance computing and OSC

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

A **supercomputer** (also known as a "compute cluster" or simply a "**cluster**")
consists of many computers that are connected by a high-speed network,
and that can be accessed remotely by its users.
In more general terms, supercomputers provide high-performance computing (**HPC**) resources.

This is what Owens, one of the OSC supercomputers, physically looks like:

![](img/owens.jpg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Here are some possible reasons to use a supercomputer instead of your own laptop or desktop:

-   Your analyses take a long time to run, need large numbers of CPUs, or a large amount of memory.
-   You need to run some analyses many times.
-   You need to store a lot of data.
-   Your analyses require specialized hardware, such as GPUs (Graphical Processing Units).
-   Your analyses require software available only for the Linux operating system, but you use Windows.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

The **Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)** is a facility provided by the state of Ohio.
It has three supercomputers, lots of storage space,
and an excellent infrastructure for accessing these resources.

#### OSC websites and "Projects"

OSC has **three main websites** --- we will mostly or only use the first:

-   **<https://ondemand.osc.edu>**: A web portal to use OSC resources through your browser (*login needed*).
-   <https://my.osc.edu>: Account and project management (*login needed*).
-   <https://osc.edu>: General website with information about the supercomputers, installed software, and usage.

----

Access to OSC's computing power and storage space goes through **OSC "Projects"**:

-   A project can be tied to a research project or lab, or be educational like Code Club's project, `PAS1838`.
-   Each project has a budget in terms of "compute hours" and storage space^[
    But we don't have to pay anything for educational projects like this one.
    Otherwise, for OSC's rates for academic research, see [this page](https://www.osc.edu/content/academic_fee_model_faq).].
-   As a user, it's possible to be a member of multiple different projects.

## The structure of a supercomputer center

### Terminology

Let's start with some (super)computing terminology, going from smaller things to bigger things:

-   **Node**\
    A single computer that is a part of a supercomputer.
-   **Supercomputer / Cluster**\
    A collection of computers connected by a high-speed network.
    OSC currently has three: "Pitzer", "Owens", and "Cardinal".
-   **Supercomputer Center**\
    A facility like OSC that has one or more supercomputers.

### Supercomputer components

We can think of a supercomputer as having three main parts:

-   **File Systems**: Where files are stored (these are shared between the two OSC supercomputers!)
-   **Login Nodes**: The handful of computers everyone shares after logging in
-   **Compute Nodes**: The many computers you can reserve to run your analyses

![](img/cluster_overview_ed.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

#### Login Nodes

Login nodes are set aside as an initial landing spot for everyone who logs in to a supercomputer. There are only a handful of them on each supercomputer, they are shared among everyone, and cannot be "reserved".

As such, login nodes are meant only to do things like organizing your files and creating scripts for compute jobs, and are ***not*** **meant for any serious computing**, which should be done on the compute nodes.

#### Compute Nodes

Data processing and analysis is done on compute nodes.
You can only use compute nodes after putting in a **request** for resources (a "job").
The Slurm *job scheduler*, which we will learn to use in week 5, will then assign resources to your request.

#### What works differently on a supercomputer like at OSC? _(Click to expand)_

Compared to command-line computing on a laptop or desktop,
a number of aspects are different when working on a supercomputer like at OSC.
We'll learn much more about these later on in the course, but here is an overview: 

-   **"Non-interactive" computing is common**\
    It is common to write and "submit" scripts to a queue instead of running programs interactively.
-   **Software**\
    You generally can't install "the regular way", and a lot of installed software needs to be "loaded".
-   **Operating system**\
    Supercomputers run on the Linux operating system.
-   **Login versus compute nodes**\
    As mentioned, the nodes you end up on after logging in are not meant for heavy computing
    and you have to *request access to "compute nodes"* to run most analyses.

#### OSC file systems _(Click to expand)_

OSC has several distinct file systems:

| File system | Located within | Quota              | Backed up? | Auto-purged?  | One for each... |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Home**        | `/users/`         | 500 GB / 1 M files | Yes        | No            | User            |
| **Project**     | `/fs/ess/`   | Flexible           | Yes        | No            | OSC Project     |
| **Scratch**     | `/fs/scratch/`    | 100 TB             | No         | After 90 days | OSC Project     |

_(Directory is just another word for folder, often written as "dir" for short.)_

## OSC OnDemand

The OSC OnDemand web portal allows you to use a web browser to access OSC resources such as:

-   A **file browser** where you can also create and rename folders and files, etc.
-   A **Unix shell**
-   "**Interactive Apps**": programs such as **_RStudio_**, Jupyter, VS Code and QGIS.

{{< fa user-edit >}} **Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> and log in** (use the boxes on the left-hand side)

You should see a landing page similar to the one below:

<p align="center">

<img src="img/ondemand_home.png" width="90%"/>

</p>

We will now go through some of the dropdown menus in the **blue bar along the top**.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Files: File system access

Hovering over the **Files** dropdown menu gives a list of directories that you have access to.
If your account is brand new, and you were added to `PAS1838`, you should only have three directories listed:

1.  A **Home** directory (starts with `/users/`)
2.  The `PAS1838` project's "_scratch_" directory for temporary project-related storage (`/fs/scratch/PAS1838`) 
3.  The `PAS1838` project's "_project_" directory for permanent project-related storage (`/fs/ess/PAS1838`)

You will only ever have one Home directory at OSC,
but for every additional project you are a member of,
you should usually see additional `/fs/ess` and `/fs/scratch` directories appear.

{{< fa user-edit >}} **Click on your Home directory**.

Once there, you should see whichever directories and files are present at the selected location,
and you can click on the directories to explore the contents further:

![](img/ondemand_files_pas2700.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"}

This interface is **much like the file browser on your own computer**, so you can also create, delete, move and copy files and folders, and even upload (from your computer to OSC) and download (from OSC your computer) files^[Though this is not meant for large (\>1 GB) transfers. Different methods are available --- we'll talk about those later on.] --- see the buttons across the top.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Clusters: Unix shell access

Interacting with a supercomputer is most commonly done using a Unix shell.
Under the **Clusters** dropdown menu, you can access a Unix shell either on Owens or Pitzer:

![](img/ondemand_shell_select.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

I'm selecting a shell on the Pitzer supercomputer ("Pitzer Shell Access"),
which will open a new browser tab, where the bottom of the page looks like this:

![](img/ondemand_shell2.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"}

The "**Clusters**" dropdown menu also has item "**System Status**".
When you click on that, a new browser tab will open with a page that
shows an overview of the live, current usage of the clusters ---
this can be useful to get an idea of the scale of the supercomputer center,
which cluster is being used more, and so on:

![](img/ondemand_systemstatus.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Interactive Apps

We can access programs with Graphical User Interfaces (**GUI**s; point-and-click interfaces)
via the **Interactive Apps** dropdown menu:

![](img/ondemand_vscode_select.png){fig-align="center" width="32%"}

## RStudio at OSC (RStudio Server)

From within our browser,
we can access a version of RStudio ("RStudio Sever") that will be running on
OSC's computers.

Some potential advantages of doing this are:

- You can access multiple different versions of R!
- You have access to OSC's compute power and could easily request say 20 cores
  or 100 GB of memory (RAM)
- You have large amounts of data that are stored on OSC anyway, or are best stored there

### Starting an RStudio Server session

1.  Click on **`Interactive Apps`** (top bar) and then **`RStudio Server`** (all the way at the bottom)

2.  Fill out the form as follows:

    -   Cluster: **`Pitzer`**
    -   R version: **`4.4.0`**
    -   Project: **`PAS1838`**
    -   Number of hours: **`1`**
    -   Node type: **`any`**
    -   Number of cores: **`1`**

![](img/rstudio_form.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

</details>

4.  Click the big blue **`Launch`** button at the bottom

5.  Now, you should be sent to a new page with a box at the top for your RStudio Server "job",
    which should initially be "Queued" (waiting to start).

<details><summary>*Click to see a screenshot*</summary>

![](img/rstudio_queued.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

</details>

6.  Your job should start running very soon, with the top bar of the box turning green and saying "Running".

<details><summary>*Click to see a screenshot*</summary>

![](img/rstudio_running.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

</details>

7.  Click **`Connect to RStudio Server`** at the bottom of the box,
    and an RStudio Server instance will open in a new browser tab. You're ready to go!

### Installing R packages

You can install R packages as usual with `install.packages()` and related functions:
these will automatically be installed in your default personal library somewhere
in your Home directory.
