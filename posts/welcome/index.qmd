Code Club has a new website, made with Quarto!

We were previously on the ["BioDASH" website](https://biodash.github.io),
which also contained some educational bioinformatics material unrelated to 
Code Club.

That website was created using R Markdown and "[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)".
A lot has happened in the realm of R Markdown websites in the meantime,
and even R Markdown itself now has a successor: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

In the AU23 semester,
we will teach making a website with Quarto,
and we therefore think it is fitting that the Code Club website itself is
also made with Quarto.
Additionally,
we think it will be nice to have a website just for Code Club content.
