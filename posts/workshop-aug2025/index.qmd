Join us to kick-off the fall semester with a hands-on workshop on using the R programming language to make your research more efficient and reproducible! [Register here](https://library.osu.edu/events/r-for-scientific-reproducibility-virtual-event-1)!

Participants will learn:

* The basics of using R in RStudio
* Best practices for code and project management
* How to explore, manipulate, and visualize data in R

This workshop will be run by your Code Club organizers and is presented in partnership with Ohio State's [Imageomics Institute](https://imageomics.osu.edu/) and the [Research Commons](https://library.osu.edu/researchcommons). It will be held on Zoom and will **not be recorded**. It is open to graduate students, faculty, and staff researchers from all disciplines and *no prior experience is required*.

Installation instructions will be sent to registrants approximately one week before the workshop. For more information, see the [workshop webpage](https://imageomics.github.io/2025-08-15-osu-online/). 

You can find all the workshop materials [here](https://osu-codeclub.github.io/carpentries-aug-2025/) or by going to the "More resources" tab at the top of this site.
