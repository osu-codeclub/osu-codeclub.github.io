During the **spring semester of 2024**, we will be starting with R from the very beginning, no coding experience required. We will begin with how to install R and RStudio, download packages, the concept of vectorization, setting directories, objects and object types, operators and much more.

We will be meeting on **Fridays from 12-1pm**. Join us:

-   In person in Columbus (**Howlett 340** with Jessica Cooperstone and Horacio Lopez-Nicora)\
-   In Wooster (**location TBD** with Jelmer Poelstra)\
-   Through **Zoom** ([sign up](https://forms.gle/eYkMvmJShrcANUrt5) to receive the Zoom link)
